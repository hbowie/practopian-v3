<p>The following summary is largely based on the work of Ken Wilber, Clare W. Graves, Don Beck and Chris Cowan.</p>

<p>Both individuals and societies can be thought of as developing through a series of levels. Higher levels of development supplement lower levels, but do not replace them. Development cannot skip a level, but can be arrested at any stage: progression entirely through the series is in no way assured.</p>

Teaser:

From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity's creation and evolution -- a # 1 international bestseller -- that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be "human."

Body:

Jared Diamond is quoted on the cover as saying "*Sapiens* tackles the biggest questions of history and of the modern world, and it is written in unforgettably vivid language," and it is hard to think of a better way to describe this important book. 

This 2015 book by Yuval Noah Harari offers a sweeping overview of the major factors that have influenced the evolution of humanity into our current state. For anyone who wants to know who we are and how we got here -- and where we might go next -- it seems an invaluable guide.

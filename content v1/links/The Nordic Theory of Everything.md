Body:

This 2016 book by Finnish-journalist-turned-American-citizen Anu Partanen offers a comprehensive comparison of American culture and governmental policies vs. those of the Nordic nations. She combines well-researched statistical data with her personal experiences of moving to America and then becoming an American citizen. While she finds much to admire in America, she also presents compelling data -- both anecdotal and statistical -- to make a convincing argument that American citizens, and the American economy, suffer from having too little access to daycare, parental leave, elder care, education and healthcare, and from spending too much time and effort trying to secure whatever sort of services they can in these areas. A great read for any American citizen wondering how our country can continue to move forward in the 21st century.

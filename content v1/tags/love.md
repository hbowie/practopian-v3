Title: love

Teaser:

Love is a [Core Principle](../core/principles.html).

Body:

Although we cannot define the meaning of the word in any comprehensive way -- or, perhaps, because we cannot fully define it -- we believe in love.

Let us call love the apprehension of something outside of oneself, some being or form that is other than our self, and yet that affirms the possibility of a greater unity of which we are each but parts, a unity that leaves us still ourselves, and yet also part of something inestimably greater.

This sensation of love may be felt in the presence of another person, or a group of people, or a work of art, or another living creature, or some element of the natural world, or in the embrace of the entire world around us.

We want to help shape a world in which there is more of this stuff: more love.

Body:

The Practopian Principles and Values intentionally avoid any mention of religion, God, or spirits. We have no intention, however, to discount or demean or disavow any particular religious text, practice or belief -- so long as these are viewed and used in ways that are compatible and consistent with our Principles and Values.

Title: Are We A Christian Nation? Or a Practopian Nation?

Teaser:

It increasingly feels like we are a society that has lost its ability to have a conversation about anything important. 

We brandish labels and slogans as weapons, divorced of any real meaning. "Liberal!" "Republican!" "Christian!" "Muslim!" "America First!" "Immigration!" "Free Trade!" "Globalization!" "Taxation!" "Regulation!" "Family Values!" And we seem to be able to come together only in opposition to something -- even if it's something of which we have little common understanding, such as the Affordable Care Act (aka "Obamacare").  

Part of the problem seems to be that we have no common definitions for what we mean by the labels we so frequently use. We have a lot of emotions tied to them, but little shared understanding of what they mean.

It increasingly feels like we are a society that has lost its ability to have a conversation about anything important. 

We brandish labels and slogans as weapons, divorced of any real meaning. "Liberal!" "Republican!" "Christian!" "Muslim!" "America First!" "Immigration!" "Free Trade!" "Globalization!" "Taxation!" "Regulation!" "Family Values!" And we seem to be able to come together only in opposition to something -- even if it's something of which we have little common understanding, such as the [Affordable Care Act (aka "Obamacare")][aca].  

Part of the problem seems to be that we have no common definitions for what we mean by the labels we so frequently use. We have a lot of emotions tied to them, but little shared understanding of what they mean. 

Note that it doesn't have to be this way. If I were to gather together a roomful of scientists, and ask them what was meant by the word "triangle," they would have no problem at all speedily reaching agreement. Yet if I were to gather together a roomful of our citizens, and ask them what was meant by the word "Christian," or what was meant by the term "Liberal," I doubt that I would hear two of the same answers, and also doubt that these good folks could reach any kind of agreement on shared definitions, no matter how long I left them in that hypothetical room. 

No wonder then that our civic discourse, which makes such frequent use of terms like these, is unable to make much headway.  

Some little time ago, after yet another unproductive conversation with family members about the state of our society, I began to wonder: is there some set of shared principles and values that could be concisely stated, and that we could potentially reach agreement on? And, more personally, could I fashion some sort of credo that represented my most fundamental beliefs, in a way that could be shared broadly and inclusively with my fellow citizens? And yet also something that was not so vague as to be completely meaningless? 

It took me a while to sift through my feelings and beliefs to arrive at answers to these questions, but I've recently come up with some words that I feel do a decent job of representing a worldview that I hold, and that I feel that many if not most of us might be able to agree to.

You can find these words in the Core section of the [Practopians][] website (short for "Practical Utopians") and, more specifically, on the two pages listing the Practopian [Principles][] and [Values][]. 

Note that these words are meant to be inclusive, not divisive: whether you consider yourself a Christian, or a Muslim, a Jew, a Buddhist, or an atheist, my hope is that you can subscribe to this set of core beliefs, and that we can use them as a basis for meaningful and constructive dialogue. 

These words are also meant to be concise: there are only a baker's dozen worth of principles, expressed in less than a thousand words, and only twelve values, stated in even less space. 

Can we agree on these shared principles and values? If not, why not? Is there something fundamental that is missing? Or is there something here you can't stomach? 

I'd love to hear your feedback. Positive or negative, question or comment, shoot me a note at [feedback@Practopian.org][feedback]. 

It would be wonderful if a majority of us could reach some agreement on just what sort of society we are.

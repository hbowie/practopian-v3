Social Structure: Shared Principles

Social Structure Description: This is a structure bound together by a shared adherence to a set of written principles, or laws. These writings are accepted as fundamental articles of faith, and are intentionally difficult or impossible to modify.  This social structure can be seen in most religions and in any sort of constitutional government.  Note that such organizations are open to anyone willing to pledge allegiance to the shared principles, without regard for a personâ€™s background or origins. 

Body:   
 
People organize themselves around mythic, fundamentalist principles of truth, with groups requiring close conformity to their particular principles, but with no reliable way to make value judgments comparing one group's "truth" to another's; group membership based on professed allegiance and obedience to shared principles, rather than on family ties or geography or membership in gangs; fundamental principles held to be absolute and unvarying; belief in the law and in an authoritarian hierarchy from which the law is passed down.

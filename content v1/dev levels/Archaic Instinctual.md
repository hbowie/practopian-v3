Color:  Beige

Social Structure: Lone Wolf

Social Structure Description: This earliest and most primitive level is really characterized by the lack of any social structure, but itâ€™s important to include it, because we are all still motivated by basic survival instincts: fight or flight, hunger, thirst, avoidance of physical danger, and so on. Some social structures can override these basic instincts -- as when a soldier goes to war to protect his or her country -- but these basic survival motivations are all still present, and so must be kept in mind and accounted for. 

Body:   
 
Focused solely on immediate survival needs; minimal sense of self; behavior based on natural instincts and reflexes; concern only for physical self and physical environment; nothing that we would recognize as society or culture.

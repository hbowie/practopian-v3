Title: Introduction

Welcome to Practopian.org, the website for Practical Utopians!

We invite you to explore our site. You'll note that it contains several different types of content.

* Our [Core Writings](../core/index.html) spell out who we are and what we're about, laying out our Background, Mission, Principles and Values.

* Our [Basics](../basics/index.html) offer extended, but still foundational, information about our core beliefs. 

* Our [Blog Posts](../blog/index.html) offer commentary on a variety of topics from a Practopian perspective.

* Our [Appreciations](../appreciation/index.html) offer original appreciations of works by others. 

* Our [Issues](../issues/index.html) section identifies the issues we feel are most important.

* We've collected a number of [Quotations](../quotes/index.html) that reflect and illustrate our core beliefs.

* We also highlight various [News Items](../news/index.html), with some brief commentary on why they're relevant to our interests.

* Our [Links](../links/index.html) section contains a collection of helpful hyperlinks to other resources -- works of art, websites -- that we recommend.

If you'd like to see what's new, you can review a list of the [latest *original* content](../explore/latest-original-content.html) added to the site, or a list of [*all* the latest content](../explore/latest-content.html), including references to content originating at other sites.

And our [Tags Index Page](../tags/index.html) presents a list of all the Tags used on the site. Most of these Tags tie back to one of our Core Principles or Values or Issues; feel free to click on any of these to delve into additional content on a particular topic.

Navigation links at the bottom of most pages can be used to proceed directly from one page to another, using any of several possible paths through the site.

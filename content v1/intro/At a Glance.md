Teaser: A one-page summary of who we are and what we're about

Body:

Here you'll find a one-page summary of who we are and what we're about.


### Background

It has seemed to me for some time that there is a space -- perhaps even a need -- for some new institution to emerge in the world. 

Our modern human landscape offers us an unprecedented degree of freedom, and fosters an almost unimaginable degree of diversity. 

But this ever-expanding palette of options invites the question: is there a broad set of cultural elements that we can agree to share, in order to promote constructive discourse about how we humans wish our society to evolve? 

Traditional religions offer one set of answers to this question.

But can we construct another option? A new institution that provides another sort of answer?

*The Practopians* is an experiment attempting to answer this very question.


### Mission

The Practical Utopian seeks to identify and promote beliefs, principles, values and actions that will result in a brighter future for humanity. 

We strive to combine a clear-eyed view of what is possible with an idealistic yearning for a better tomorrow. 

By documenting in an inclusive and transparent manner a foundational modern worldview, we hope to launch something that might be thought of as the world's first open-source religion. 

We will work to advance our cause through authoring, publication, education, scientific advocacy, and promotion of literature and the arts as vital elements of human culture.

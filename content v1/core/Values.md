Body:

The Values form a framework for action, a set of goals we'd like to satisfy, to the greatest extent possible. 

01. [Balance](../tags/balance.html): We believe in striving for **[balance][]** between competing concerns. Although all of the values on this list are important to us, we have no desire to establish any one of them as fundamentally absolute.

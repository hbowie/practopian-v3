				<p>This is a lovely little song, written by Terre Roche and recorded <em>a cappella</em> by <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-roches-mn0000791120">The Roches</a> for their Christmas album, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Three-Kings-Roches/dp/B000009V0M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1513703150&sr=1-1&keywords=the+roches+we+three+kings&linkCode=ll1&tag=wordsaboutsongs-20&linkId=1fa75b3ff92461ed853fbb879a54a300"><em>We Three Kings</em></a>. </p>
<p>If you haven't yet heard it, then you should <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/star-of-wonder/1443869614?i=1443870076">listen to it now</a>. </p>
<p>The beauty of this song, to my mind, is the way it singles out and humanizes one character, and one experience, out of the story of Jesus' birth. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Star of wonder in the heavens,  <br />
 Wonder what you want of me.  <br />
 Should I follow you tonight?  <br />
 Star of wonder, star of wonder.</p>
<p>I am just a lonely shepherd  <br />
 Watching from a distant hill.  <br />
 Why do you appear to me?  <br />
 Star of wonder, if you will.  </p>
<p>In the morning they'll come looking  <br />
 For the shepherd on the hill.  <br />
 What would make her leave her flock  <br />
 For surely she must love them still?  </p>
<p>Star of Wonder in the heavens,  <br />
 Are you just a shining star  <br />
 Or should I follow you tonight?  <br />
 Star of wonder, star of wonder,   <br />
 Shining bright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The performance matches the lyrics perfectly, delivering the song fully and completely with nothing more than three quiet, wondrous human voices. </p>
<p>Many holiday songs fall cleanly into either a secular or a religious camp: you can drink your egg nog or you can worship Christ. And, of course, some of the <a href="christmas-favorites-from-the-practical-utopian.html">songs I favor</a> tend to talk of Christmas from a humanistic, ethical perspective. </p>
<p>This song does something different. Jesus Christ is never spoken of, either directly or indirectly. The words &#8220;Christmas&#8221; and &#8220;holiday&#8221; are never used. There are no direct Christian references at all. </p>
<p>Instead we are asked to consider, simply, the feelings of a lonely shepherd who has the singular experience of seeing a star appear that seems to beckon to her, and ask her to follow. And that's it. </p>
<p>However, by focusing so tightly on one character, and one scene, Terre Roche manages to paint a picture that includes all of us. For this is not just the story of one shepherd being called to witness the birth of Christ: it is the story of every human who has ever experienced a sense of wonder, who has felt a calling to something higher, and has paused to consider whether to follow that star, or to return to normal daily life.  </p>
<p>Terre and her two sisters certainly felt that calling, and instilled and shared a sense of wonder for many years with listeners all 'round the world, including an audience I felt privileged to be part of in Seattle not too many years ago. </p>
<p>Terre Roche has kindly provided <a href="http://www.roches.com/scores/sow.html">words and music</a> to her lovely little song for those who are interested. </p>

<p>This is a bluegrass song written by Bell Labs engineer and bluegrass fiddler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_F._Logan">Benjamin &#8220;Tex&#8221; Logan</a>, and first recorded by Bill Monroe in 1951. </p>
<p>This song has a similar theme to &#8220;<a href="christmas-time-back-home-song-by-the-country-gentlemen.html">Christmas Time Back Home</a>&#8221;, but has a very different feel to it. Whereas &#8220;Christmas Time Back Home&#8221; is full of yearning, this song always seems to me to be full of sheer joy. </p>
<p>Note the song's unusual construction. It starts with what we would typically call the chorus, and then launches into the first verse. But then after the verse, we get a new chorus, followed by the original chorus, and both of these are then repeated after each successive verse. </p>
<p>I love the pacing of the song. The first chorus expresses quiet anticipation, the verse paints a picture of the beloved country home, and the second chorus then seems to cut loose with pure joy. The singer claims at one point that he &#8220;can't walk for running,&#8221; and you can feel this in the music. </p>
<p>Different performers seem to put the verses in different orders, but otherwise the lyrics remain fairly constant from one performance to another. </p>
<p>Forgive the repetition, but I'll just put down all the lyrics, including the choruses, to make sure the song's construction is clear. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christmas Time's A-Coming!  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming.  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming,  <br />
 And I know I'm going home.  </p>
<p>Snow flakes a-falling!  <br />
 My old home's a-calling.  <br />
 Tall pines a-humming,  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming.  </p>
<p>Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing,  <br />
 Joy to all, hear them singing,  <br />
 When it's snowing, I'll be going,  <br />
 Back to my country home.  </p>
<p>Christmas Time's A-Coming!  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming.  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming,  <br />
 And I know I'm going home.   </p>
<p>White candles burning,  <br />
 My old heart's a-yearning,  <br />
 For the folks at home when  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming.  </p>
<p>Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing,  <br />
 Joy to all, hear them singing,  <br />
 When it's snowing, I'll be going,  <br />
 Back to my country home.   </p>
<p>Christmas Time's A-Coming  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming  <br />
 And I know I'm going home.  </p>
<p>Holly's in the window,  <br />
 Home where the wind blows,  <br />
 Can't walk for running,  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming.  </p>
<p>Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing,  <br />
 Joy, joy, hear them singing,  <br />
 When it's snowing, I'll be going,  <br />
 Back to my country home.   </p>
<p>Christmas Time's A-Coming  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming  <br />
 And I know I'm going home.  </p>
<p>Christmas Time's A-Coming  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming  <br />
 Christmas Time's A-Coming  <br />
 And I know I'm going home.  </p>

<p>I first heard this song on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Time-Back-Country-Gentlemen/dp/B00000024V/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1512686177&sr=8-1&keywords=Christmas+Time+back+home&linkCode=ll1&tag=wordsaboutsongs-20&linkId=9dbcd90b70b41aae1415561ab8f5b843"><em>Christmas Time Back Home</em></a> album, as performed by Larry Sparks, and still think this is a fine version of the song. But the <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/christmas-times-a-coming/28457929?i=28457931&mt=1&app=music&at=1l3vwJP">one I'll recommend to you today is by Emmylou Harris</a>, and can be found on her excellent album, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stable-Expanded-Remastered-Emmylou-Harris/dp/B000641Z3Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1513801604&sr=1-1&keywords=emmylou+harris+light+of+the+stable&linkCode=ll1&tag=wordsaboutsongs-20&linkId=bbab995883ccff03a1869184bcc4ee5d"><em>The Light of the Stable</em></a>. </p>

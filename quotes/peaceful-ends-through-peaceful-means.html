<h1>Peaceful ends through peaceful means</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>One day, we must come to see that peace is not merely a distant goal we seek, but that it is a means by which we arrive at that goal. We must pursue peaceful ends through peaceful means. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Martin Luther King Jr., April 1967</p>

<h1>Our political system is not equipped to deliver solutions</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, a democracy where it's nearly impossible to move legislation is bad for everyone. But it's uniquely bad for progressives. We actually want to change things. We urgently need to change things. Our societal problems &#8211; climate change, health care, gun violence, economic and racial inequity &#8211; are getting worse every day. Our political system is not equipped to deliver solutions &#8211; in fact, it's equipped to block them. And every election, the gap between what our politicians promise and what they're able to deliver widens &#8211; and faith in our system gets a little weaker. </p>

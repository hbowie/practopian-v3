<h1>The time-worn yoke of their opinions</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>He who should inspire and lead his race must be defended from travelling with the souls of other men, from living, breathing, reading, and writing in the daily, time-worn yoke of their opinions. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1860</p>

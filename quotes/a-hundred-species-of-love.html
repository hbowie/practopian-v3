<h1>A Hundred Species of Love</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>She takes his shaking hand in the dark. It feels good, like a root must feel when it finds, after centuries, another root to pleach to underground. There are a hundred species of love, separately invented, each more ingenious than the last, and every one of them keeps making things. </p>

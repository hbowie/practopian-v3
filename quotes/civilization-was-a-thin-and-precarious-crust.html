<h1>Civilization was a thin and precarious crust</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>We were not aware that civilization was a thin and precarious crust erected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained by rules and conventions skilfully put across and guilefully preserved. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; John Maynard Keynes, 1938</p>

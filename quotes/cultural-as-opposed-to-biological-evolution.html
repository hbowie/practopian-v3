<h1>Cultural, as opposed to biological, evolution</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Our capacity, through language, to manipulate the mental world and so deal imaginatively with the world of experience has been a major factor, perhaps the major factor, in giving humans the overwhelming advantage over other species in terms of cultural, as opposed to biological, evolution. </p>

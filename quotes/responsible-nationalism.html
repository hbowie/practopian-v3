<blockquote>
<p>Lawrence Summers complained of &#8216;the development of stateless elites whose allegiance is to global economic success and their own prosperity rather than the interests of the nation where they are headquartered&#8217;. By 2016, he was warning that the public's tolerance for expert solutions &#8216;appears to have been exhausted&#8217;. He advised a new &#8216;responsible nationalism&#8217;, which would &#8216;begin from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximize the welfare of its citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good&#8217;. The global elites, in other words, need to catch up with how most people view the world &#8211; not the other way round. </p>

<h1>To live wisely and agreeably and well</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus for the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem &#8211; how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well. </p>

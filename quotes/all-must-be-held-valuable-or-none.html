<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;But none of us has the right to assess the value of a human existence. All must be held valuable, or none. The death of Christ and the death of Socrates,&#8221; Fen added dryly, &#8220;suggest that our judgments are scarcely infallible&#8230; And the evil of Nazism lay precisely in this, that a group of men began to differentiate between the value of their fellow-beings, and to act on their conclusions. It isn't a habit which I, for one, would like to encourage.&#8221; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beavers build houses; but they build them in nowise differently, or better, now than they did five thousand years ago&#8230;. Man is not the only animal who labors; but he is the only one who improves his workmanship. These improvements he effects by Discoveries and Inventions. </p>

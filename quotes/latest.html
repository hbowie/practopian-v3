						<p>In other words, while social conservatives have a philosophy of family life they can’t operationalize, because it no longer is relevant, progressives have no philosophy of family life at all, because they don’t want to seem judgmental. The sexual revolution has come and gone, and it’s left us with no governing norms of family life, no guiding values, no articulated ideals. On this most central issue, our shared culture often has nothing relevant to say—and so for decades things have been falling apart. </p>

That will not be a good outcome for society. We need governments to provide clear pathways and a consistent taxonomy for sustainability policy, regulation, and disclosure across markets. When we harness the power of both the public and private sectors, we can achieve truly incredible things. This is what we must do to get to net zero. </p>

						<p>The increase of wealth is not boundless. A stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement. There would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture, and moral and social progress; as much room for improving the art of living, and much more likelihood of it being improved, when minds ceased to be engrossed by the art of getting on. </p>

						<p>I give them [other business owners] the same advice my grandfather had when he was starting the business [Dick&#8217;s Drive-Ins]. A business, first step, is it has to make a profit. The next step is to invest in your employees. They&#8217;ll take better care of your customers, which will help you earn more profit. When they move on from your business and do other things, they&#8217;re evangelists for your company and that helps you make more profit. Once that virtuous cycle is going, you can also invest in your community because if your community is thriving, your business will thrive. And so for these businesses that come to us asking what they should do first, the biggest thing I tell them is to talk to your employees. Ask them what it is that your employee population would want. Talk to them! Start with that. And if you can&#8217;t do it for everybody or everything that they would want, just do some part of it, then work your way up from there. </p>

				<h2>Learn why the world wags and what wags it</h2>

						<p>You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorders of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then &#8211; to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. </p>

						<p>Here&#8217;s the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don&#8217;t find it anywhere else. Songs like &#8220;Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain&#8221; or &#8220;I Saw the Light&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s my religion. I don&#8217;t adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I&#8217;ve learned more from the songs than I&#8217;ve learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs. </p>

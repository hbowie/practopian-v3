<h1>To simply see human beings</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>If I ask you all today to look around and tell me who you see&#8230;. When you look around, I don't want you to see black, white, Asian, I don't want you to wonder if a person is Democrat or Republican, gay or straight. When you look around, I just want you to simply see human beings &#8211; nothing more, nothing less. And I guarantee you, if you can begin to see people that way, just as human beings, you'll begin to treat them a little differently, you'll begin to understand their points of view. </p>

<h1>The Power of Art</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>When I started learning about jazz, I wasn't into any kind of art. I had no idea it could have a practical purpose. Now, more than thirty years later, I testify to the power of art, and more specifically jazz, to improve your life&#8211;and keep on improving it. </p>

</blockquote>

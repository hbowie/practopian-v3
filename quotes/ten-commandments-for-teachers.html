<h1>Ten Commandments for Teachers</h1>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do not feel absolutely certain of anything. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool's paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness. </p>
</li>
</ol>

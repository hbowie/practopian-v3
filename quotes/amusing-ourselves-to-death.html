<h1>Amusing ourselves to death</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Our politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death. </p>

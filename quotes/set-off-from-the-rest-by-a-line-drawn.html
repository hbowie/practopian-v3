<h1>Set off from the rest by a line drawn</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Of all dangers to a nation, as things exist in our day, there can be no greater one than having certain portions of the people set off from the rest by a line drawn &#8211; they not privileged as others, but degraded, humiliated, made of no account. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Walt Whitman, 1871</p>

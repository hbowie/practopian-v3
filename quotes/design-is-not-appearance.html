<h1>Design is not Appearance</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Design is not appearance, but a way of thinking about information and conveying ideas to others. Thatâ€™s really what I do. I am so interested in having ideas. That idea that your role in the culture is to inform and delight is so sweet. Not to persuade, not to persuade! </p>

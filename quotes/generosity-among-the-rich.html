<h1>Generosity Among the Rich</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the rich you will never find a really generous man even by accident. They may give their money away, but they will never give themselves away; they are egotistic, secretive, dry as old bones. To be smart enough to get all that money you must be dull enough to want it. </p>

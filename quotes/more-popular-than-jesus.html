<h1>More Popular than Jesus</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go firstâ€”rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; John Lennon, 1966</p>

<h1>The welfare of the whole human race</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The twentieth century will be chiefly remembered by future generations not as an era of political conflicts or technical inventions, but as an age in which human society dared to think of the welfare of the whole human race as a practical objective. </p>

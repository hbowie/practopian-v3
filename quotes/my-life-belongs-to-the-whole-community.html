<h1>My Life Belongs to the Whole Community</h1>

<p>tags: <a href='../tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. </p>
<p>I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community, and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. </p>
<p>I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no &#8220;brief candle&#8221; for me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations. </p>

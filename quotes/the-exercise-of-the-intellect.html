<h1>The exercise of the intellect</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>From the time when the exercise of the intellect became a source of strength and of wealth, we see that every addition to science, every fresh truth and every new idea became a germ of power placed within the reach of the people. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Alexis de Tocqueville, 1835</p>

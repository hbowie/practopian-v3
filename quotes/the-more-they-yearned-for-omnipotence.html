<h1>The more they yearned for omnipotence</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Blackwell was a sad and troubled man, hardly competent to play God with anybodyâ€™s life. But the sadder and more troubled they were, the more they yearned for omnipotence. The really troubled ones believed they had it. </p>

</blockquote>

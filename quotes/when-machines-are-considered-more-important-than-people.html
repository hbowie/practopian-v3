<h1>When machines are considered more important than people</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, economic exploitation, and militarism are incapable of being conquered. A civilization can flounder as readily in the face of moral bankruptcy as it can through financial bankruptcy. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Martin Luther King Jr., Aug 31, 1967</p>

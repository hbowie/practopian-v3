<h1>Living with the strains of complexity</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Political society wants things simple. Political scientists know them to be complex&#8230; One could argue that, in part, the leftist impulse is so conspicuous among the educated and well-to-do precisely because they are exposed to more information, and are accordingly forced to choose between living with the strains of complexity, or lapsing into simplism. </p>

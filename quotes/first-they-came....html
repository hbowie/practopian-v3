<p>First they came for the communists,  and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist. </p>
<p>Then they came for the trade unionists,  and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist. </p>
<p>Then they came for the Jews,  and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew. </p>
<p>Then they came for me  and there was no one left to speak out for me.</p>

<h1>Merely a Muddle</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;And your remarks on the text,&#8221; Mr. Gott declared, &#8220;are merely a muddle.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Gott,&#8221; said Mike meekly. </p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Mike, you haven't any <em>brain</em> really.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;No, of course not,&#8221; said Mike. </p>
<p>&#8220;You must just keep to the cackle and write nicely. You write very nicely.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mike, dubiously. </p>
<p>&#8220;Keep off thinking things out, and you'll do well. In fact, you'll go far.&#8221; </p>

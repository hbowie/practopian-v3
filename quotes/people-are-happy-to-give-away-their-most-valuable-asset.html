<h1>People are happy to give away their most valuable asset</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>At present, people are happy to give away their most valuable asset &#8211; their personal data &#8211; in exchange for free email services and funny cat videos. It's a bit like African and Native American tribes who unwittingly sold entire countries to European imperialists in exchange for colorful beads and cheap trinkets. </p>

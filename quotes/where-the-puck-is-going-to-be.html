<h1>Where the Puck is Going to Be</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>There's an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. &#8216;I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.&#8217; And we've always tried to do that at Apple. Since the very very beginning. And we always will. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Steve Jobs, 2007</p>

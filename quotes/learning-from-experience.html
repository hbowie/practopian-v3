<h1>Learning from Experience</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The most powerful learning comes from direct experience. But what happens when we can no longer observe the consequences of our actions? Herein lies the core <em>learning dilemma</em> that confronts organizations:<em> we learn best from experience but we never directly experience the consequences of many of our most important decisions.</em> The most critical decisions made in organizations have systemwide consequences that stretch over years or decades. </p>

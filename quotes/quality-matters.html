<h1>Quality Matters</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality matters, and much of the evidence suggests that while developing countries are encouraging and fostering meritocracy, their Western rivals are increasingly approaching academe with an egalitarian flare &#8211; more access (of course, with the benefit of widening educational opportunity) even if at the expense of quality. </p>

<p>I am happy to make all of my Practical Utopian content free for anyone to read, without any fees, personal data collection or advertising. </p> 

<p>But if you would like to express your appreciation for my work by making a small financial donation, then all gifts will be gratefully accepted!<p>

<p>Clicking on the button below will take you to a page on the Ko-fi site, where you can "buy me a coffee," if you'd like.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

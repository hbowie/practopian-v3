The most dangerous of devotions, in my opinion, is the one endemic to Christianity: <em>I was not born to be of this world.</em> With a second life waiting, suffering can be endured -- especially in other people. The natural environment can be used up. Enemies of the faith can be savaged and suicidal martyrdom praised.

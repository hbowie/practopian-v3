			&lt;p&gt;In line with the famous quote from Ernest Hemingway, the Republican Party seems to see their fortunes on the decline &amp;#8211; gradually for now &amp;#8211; but perhaps suddenly before much longer. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;No matter where you stand on the political spectrum, questions surrounding free speech are hot-button items these days. Should anyone be free to say anything, about anyone, at any time, and to any audience? If not, who&apos;s responsible for moderation, and what are the rules? And at what point does moderation become censorship? &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The invasion of our Capitol building on January 6th, 2021, and the accompanying disruption of the work of our duly elected members of Congress, was certainly an unprecedented and frightening addition to our American history books.  And yet, despite all of the terrifying and shocking things we witnessed during this day, the one thing we &lt;em&gt;didn&apos;t&lt;/em&gt; see was any serious attempt to seize power, or to overthrow our government. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We all would like a quick fix of simple certainty, and no matter where we turn today, we can find an army of pushers waiting to feed our habit, even giving the stuff away for free, just to keep us hooked. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m tempted to call the story heartbreaking, but it&apos;s more like brain-breaking: how can people who are so sick that they have to be hospitalized still refuse to believe in the existence of the very disease that is killing them? &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The history of Leonard Cohen&apos;s song &amp;#8220;Hallelujah&amp;#8221; is a fascinating one. Cohen&apos;s songs had never really been embraced by the masses, and his first recording of &amp;#8220;Hallelujah&amp;#8221; in the early eighties was part of an album so lacking in obvious commercial appeal that the president of CBS Records responded to it by saying: &amp;#8220;What is this? This isn&apos;t pop music. We&apos;re not releasing it. This is a disaster.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There is a flaw in the reasoning behind our infernal, never-ending, society-splitting debate concerning socialism vs. capitalism, and I want to point it out. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When historians look at the long span of our human history, they try to make sense of our arc of cultural evolution by breaking it up into phases. There are multiple perspectives we can use for this sort of exercise, but the most important is the relationship of our human population to the rest of our world. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I can tell from my occasional conversations with friends and relatives who vote Republican that they have been thoroughly brainwashed about what we liberals stand for in the modern era. So let me lift the veil of secrecy and reveal some of our deepest, darkest secrets. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;With a little luck, and a lot of hard work, we might be fortunate enough to see Donald Trump leave office in a few months. If so, that will be the end of the Trump presidency. Unfortunately, though, it won&apos;t mean the end of Trumpism. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When we look at the major societal choices facing us today, the primary question is not whether we want a society that is more cooperative or more competitive, but whether we&apos;re ready for a society that is less coercive. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As with many of us, I&apos;ve been thinking deeply lately about the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breanna Taylor, and so many other people of color, and wondering how and why these atrocities continue to occur in my country, and what we can do to turn things around. And I&apos;ve concluded that there are basically two types of human societies, with very different ways of thinking about themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As Americans we generally believe in capitalism as a superior economic system, and are typically convinced that our country is run on capitalistic principles. But I&apos;ve been wondering lately: If these things are really true, then why do so few Americans actually possess any capital?  &lt;br /&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I recently came across the Playing for Change Song Around the World video of Robbie Robertson&apos;s composition “The Weight,” and it made me want to think – and write! – more deeply about how this song works, and what it means, and the timeless nature of its appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

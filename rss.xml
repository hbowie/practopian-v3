			&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of language as playground again this week while listening to Delbert McClinton’s latest album, &lt;em&gt;Outdated Emotion&lt;/em&gt;. The work consists primarily of covers of material that Delbert learned to love while growing up, and I was already familiar with many of them, but one in particular caught my ear, called “Setting’ The Woods on Fire.” &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If execs cannot mandate the same corporate attire for everyone, what makes them think that mandating a certain number of days per week in the office is a good thing? The same flaw lurks in both approaches: every employee is not the same. Every situation is not the same. Every team is not the same. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Every state will once again be empowered to set its own rules on abortion, and we will have taken one more step away from the United States of America, and towards the disjointed, discombobulated, and largely autonomous fifty states of middle North America. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Autocracy may sometimes sound like an easy, neat, plausible solution to all of our current problems. Unfortunately, in actual practice, it doesn&amp;#8217;t generally work out so well. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The common thread running through these three incidents is this particularly American problem we seem to have that a black male, no matter what his achievements, no matter how far he has come, will never quite be able to enjoy the degree of respect that he has legitimately earned. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Of all human activities, war is the one that has the most catastrophic short-term effects. As someone who knew what he was talking about once said: &amp;#8220;War is hell.&amp;#8221; Which means that, when one nation goes to war against another,  someone in power has judged that there are much more consequential long-term benefits to be gained. So what will be the outcomes of this war that Russia has launched against Ukraine? &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve probably heard a bit in the news lately about Spotify, Neil Young, Joe Rogan and Brené Brown. But what are the real issues at stake in this evolving controversy? Censorship? Greed? Free Speech? Big Tech? Let me break it down for you. &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Does the US Need a New, More Centrist, Political Party?</title>

			&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time for a new party that is explicitly centrist, and explicitly denounces extremism at both ends of our political spectrum. Creating such a new party will no doubt be a large and expensive  and difficult enterprise, fraught with challenges, but I don&amp;#8217;t believe any better choices are left to us. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;To beat Ohio State at football is a terribly hard thing to do. That&amp;#8217;s the way it&amp;#8217;s been for over a hundred years. And that&amp;#8217;s the way it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be. It&amp;#8217;s not supposed to be easy. The outcome is never certain. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I can remember with wonderful clarity the evening when I received my LSAT scores in the mail. I had recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in English – after switching majors from Engineering a year or so into my academic career – and was living with my father and his second wife in Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I think there are a few very broad lessons we Americans can learn from the rapid fall of the Afghan government over the last few days. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
			&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we might come around to thinking that economic kindness, instead of being something indulged in capriciously by bleeding-heart liberals who are occasionally feeling generous, should in fact be a regular practice that is designed into our societies.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been making the case lately that the Republican Party is in decline, and needs to reinvent itself. But perhaps something even more radical is needed. For when we look at the current state of our two-party system in the US, nothing about it makes any sense. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As children, our thoughts about death are stuff of dreams and fairy tales. As adults we learn to suppress these thoughts because we are busy getting on with things. But as teenagers, in this transition between nursery rhymes and real life, we tend to approach this topic with a frankness and curiosity that can be somewhat startling. Laura Nyro wrote her song &amp;#8220;And When I Die&amp;#8221; at the age of 17, and her refreshing treatment of the subject shows none of the reverence or piety that we learn to adopt as adults. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a piece offering &amp;#8220;Some Hard-Won Wisdom Concerning Cults.&amp;#8221; And I&amp;#8217;ve written a couple of pieces recently questioning the direction of the current Republican Party. And so, today, I want to ask the question: should either, or both, of our political parties be considered cults? &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;So now the Republicans seem doomed to act like some strange variety of lemmings, unable to turn back from the cliff after their leader has jumped, but unable to turn away. And so they spend every day of their lives dancing along the edge, trying to convince the rest of us how good life will be at the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;

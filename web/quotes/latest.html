				<p><span class="pr-topics-label">topics:</span> <a class='btn btn-secondary btn-sm mx-1 my-1 pr-topic' href='../tags/us-politics.html' rel='tag'>US Politics</a></p>

				<div class="pr-content">
					<blockquote>
						<p>The cultural backlash theory comes from the political scientists Pippa Norris and Ron Inglehart. Inglehart, who died last year, is famous for tracking the post-materialist turn in global politics. Starting around the 1970s, generations raised in relative affluence began to care less about traditional economic issues and more about questions of personal autonomy and social values. The core fights of politics turned away from the distribution of money to the preservation of the environment and women’s bodily autonomy and marriage equality. </p>

<p>These changes were generational, and they’ve moved steadily from the margins of politics to the center. That’s led to a backlash among those opposed to, or simply disoriented by, the speed at which social mores are shifting, and the rise, in countries all over the world, of a post-materialist right. That’s led to a slew of right-wing parties that care more about culture and identity than tax cuts and deregulation. </p>

				<h2>The system-vs-goals model</h2>

				<div class="pr-content">
					<blockquote>
						<p>If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal. </p>

<p>… </p>

<p>[O]ne should have a system instead of a goal. The system-versus-goals model can be applied to most human endeavours. In the world of dieting, losing twenty pounds is a goal, but eating right is a system. In the exercise realm, running a marathon in under four hours is a goal, but exercising daily is a system. In business, making a million dollars is a goal, but being a serial entrepreneur is a system. </p>

<p>… </p>

<p>Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous pre-success failure at best, and permanent failure at worst if things never work out. Systems people succeed every time they apply their systems, in the sense that they did what they intended to do. The goals people are fighting the feeling of discouragement at each turn. The systems people are feeling good every time they apply their system. That’s a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in the right direction. </p>

						<p>Unlike modern readers, who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to end, early modern Englishmen read in fits and starts and jumped from book to book.

Then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality. </p>

						<p>Most primates, including humans, are intensely social, and there are very few instances of lone primates surviving in the wild. A modern soldier returning from combat &#8211; or a survivor of Sarajevo &#8211; goes from the kind of close-knit group that humans evolved for, back into a society where most people work outside the home, children are educated by strangers, families are isolated from wider communities, and personal gain almost completely eclipses collective good. Even if he or she is part of a family, that is not the same as belonging to a group that shares resources and experiences almost everything collectively. Whatever the technological advances of modern society &#8211; and they&#8217;re nearly miraculous &#8211; the individualized lifestyles that those technologies spawn seem to be deeply brutalizing to the human spirit. </p>

						<p>Two of the behaviors that set early humans apart were the systematic sharing of food and altruistic group defense. Other primates did very little of either but, increasingly, hominids did, and those behaviors set them on an evolutionary path that produced the modern world. The earliest and most basic definition of community &#8211; of tribe &#8211; would be the group of people that you would both help feed and help defend. A society that doesn&#8217;t offer its members the chance to act selflessly in these ways isn&#8217;t a society in any tribal sense of the word; it&#8217;s just a political entity that, lacking enemies, will probably fall apart on its own. </p>

						<p>Mastery of the inner world, with a relative contempt for the outer, must inevitably lead to great catastrophe. Mastery of the outer world, to the exclusion of the inner, delivers us over to the demonic forces of the latter, and keeps us barbaric despite all outward forms of culture. </p>

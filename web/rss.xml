			&lt;p&gt;These are the elements of a generalized improvement process, integrating components of natural selection, the scientific method and various disciplines for product and process improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Producing speech that sounds meaningful but has no genuine thought behind it is nothing new &amp;#8211; humans have been doing this for years, without any help from newfangled chatbots. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I have a leadership video I&amp;#8217;d like to share with you. And then I&amp;#8217;d like to point out several valuable leadership lessons to be gleaned from this entertaining tale of a fiery confrontation between famed football coach Bo Schembechler and one of his student athletes, as recounted by award-winning raconteur John U. Bacon. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Southerner Thomas Wolfe, in his book &lt;em&gt;You Can&amp;#8217;t Go Home Again&lt;/em&gt;, wrote about our inability to travel back in time and return to our origins. John Hiatt seemed to have had much the same sentiments in mind when he penned his song &amp;#8220;Train to Birmingham.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Many people had gotten used to thinking of Twitter as a sort of public space, a digital town square where every reasonable person could find their own soapbox, and perhaps even a few people to stop and listen to them once in a while. But then Musk came along. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
			&lt;p&gt;After staying at a pleasantly ignorable level for years, inflation is once again making headlines. And so the pundits and talking heads are falling over each other trying to explain what&amp;#8217;s going on. But I still think most of them have a hold of the wrong end of the stick. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about this song by Robert Earl Keen first recorded by Joe Ely for his &lt;em&gt;Love and Danger&lt;/em&gt; album, released in 1992. This is a song about the importance of showing care to others, through our words and our deeds. And about the implacable consequences of failures to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Back on 7 Apr 2021 I wrote a piece titled &amp;#8220;The Decline of the Republican Party - First Gradually and then Suddenly.&amp;#8221; Well, for those who haven&amp;#8217;t been paying attention lately, the &lt;em&gt;suddenly&lt;/em&gt; part has now finally arrived. So what will the Republicans do now? They face a number of significant challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a little while since I&amp;#8217;ve posted anything from The Practical Utopian, so I thought it might be time to give everyone an update on what I&amp;#8217;ve been up to over the last couple of months, including: updates to my Mac App Notenik, the new website LexiconOfSong.org, and the reborn site PortableWisdom.org. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
			&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a lot lately about human tribes. And all of these works make good points about our basic need to be part of a small, supportive community. But here&amp;#8217;s one observation that seems to me to be getting too little consideration, among all this interest in early human tribes: We modern humans are multi-tribal. That is, we tend to belong to, not one, but to many tribes. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
			&lt;p&gt;Along with many others, of course, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the abortion issue of late.  And I&amp;#8217;m reminded of the classic album by Graham Parker, &lt;em&gt;Squeezing Out Sparks&lt;/em&gt;, as well as other personal and cultural reference points. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As was true for Irish poet W. B. Yeats a century ago, we seem to be watching things fall apart, without a dynamic center to hold us together, and with the monsters  at our door: are we willing to do anything about it? &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Popping the Hood with the Notenik App</title>

		<description>
			&lt;p&gt;My dad was a mechanical engineer. His first car was a Ford of some ancient vintage, and he grew up working on engines, knowing he could always &amp;#8220;pop the hood&amp;#8221; to see what was going on underneath, and adjust it if necessary. But the trend in most modern app development is to discourage hood popping. That&amp;#8217;s where Notenik is different. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of language as playground again this week while listening to Delbert McClinton’s latest album, &lt;em&gt;Outdated Emotion&lt;/em&gt;. The work consists primarily of covers of material that Delbert learned to love while growing up, and I was already familiar with many of them, but one in particular caught my ear, called “Setting’ The Woods on Fire.” &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If execs cannot mandate the same corporate attire for everyone, what makes them think that mandating a certain number of days per week in the office is a good thing? The same flaw lurks in both approaches: every employee is not the same. Every situation is not the same. Every team is not the same. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Every state will once again be empowered to set its own rules on abortion, and we will have taken one more step away from the United States of America, and towards the disjointed, discombobulated, and largely autonomous fifty states of middle North America. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Autocracy may sometimes sound like an easy, neat, plausible solution to all of our current problems. Unfortunately, in actual practice, it doesn&amp;#8217;t generally work out so well. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The common thread running through these three incidents is this particularly American problem we seem to have that a black male, no matter what his achievements, no matter how far he has come, will never quite be able to enjoy the degree of respect that he has legitimately earned. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Of all human activities, war is the one that has the most catastrophic short-term effects. As someone who knew what he was talking about once said: &amp;#8220;War is hell.&amp;#8221; Which means that, when one nation goes to war against another,  someone in power has judged that there are much more consequential long-term benefits to be gained. So what will be the outcomes of this war that Russia has launched against Ukraine? &lt;/p&gt;

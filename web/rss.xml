			&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been a fan of Jesse Winchester&amp;#8217;s for a long time, but hadn&amp;#8217;t really paid much attention to this gem until I stumbled across it a few days ago. It&amp;#8217;s a fine addition to Winchester&amp;#8217;s small but accomplished set of songs about god and religion. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;This is a gem of a Dylan song: not a big, gaudy rock, but a modest yet finely wrought masterpiece.  I find Dylan&amp;#8217;s original version to be a bit slow and somnolent, but the song comes alive for me when I hear Sarah Jarosz sing it. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As I’ve confessed on previous occasions, I don’t really think of myself as a Christian, although I was raised by at least one parent who was a reliable Methodist for most of her life. But I’ve been reflecting on the Christian message recently, and since Christmas is approaching, I suppose there’s no better time of year for this sort of contemplation. When I think of the overarching message of Christ, three central concepts stand out for me. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I first heard this song as part of the soundtrack to a movie with the same name, made by Peter Bogdanovich in 1981. The movie is worth watching, if you like quirky (as I generally do), but it was the song that stuck with me. This was really my introduction to the songs of George and Ira Gershwin, with George supplying the music, and brother Ira providing the lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
			&lt;p&gt;While reading David R. Samson&amp;#8217;s book &lt;em&gt;Our Tribal Drive&lt;/em&gt; I came across a new concept, called an identity stack. This seems to be a really useful way to think about our identities, and how they are constructed. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Producing speech that sounds meaningful but has no genuine thought behind it is nothing new &amp;#8211; humans have been doing this for years, without any help from newfangled chatbots. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I have a leadership video I&amp;#8217;d like to share with you. And then I&amp;#8217;d like to point out several valuable leadership lessons to be gleaned from this entertaining tale of a fiery confrontation between famed football coach Bo Schembechler and one of his student athletes, as recounted by award-winning raconteur John U. Bacon. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Southerner Thomas Wolfe, in his book &lt;em&gt;You Can&amp;#8217;t Go Home Again&lt;/em&gt;, wrote about our inability to travel back in time and return to our origins. John Hiatt seemed to have had much the same sentiments in mind when he penned his song &amp;#8220;Train to Birmingham.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Many people had gotten used to thinking of Twitter as a sort of public space, a digital town square where every reasonable person could find their own soapbox, and perhaps even a few people to stop and listen to them once in a while. But then Musk came along. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
			&lt;p&gt;After staying at a pleasantly ignorable level for years, inflation is once again making headlines. And so the pundits and talking heads are falling over each other trying to explain what&amp;#8217;s going on. But I still think most of them have a hold of the wrong end of the stick. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about this song by Robert Earl Keen first recorded by Joe Ely for his &lt;em&gt;Love and Danger&lt;/em&gt; album, released in 1992. This is a song about the importance of showing care to others, through our words and our deeds. And about the implacable consequences of failures to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Back on 7 Apr 2021 I wrote a piece titled &amp;#8220;The Decline of the Republican Party - First Gradually and then Suddenly.&amp;#8221; Well, for those who haven&amp;#8217;t been paying attention lately, the &lt;em&gt;suddenly&lt;/em&gt; part has now finally arrived. So what will the Republicans do now? They face a number of significant challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a little while since I&amp;#8217;ve posted anything from The Practical Utopian, so I thought it might be time to give everyone an update on what I&amp;#8217;ve been up to over the last couple of months, including: updates to my Mac App Notenik, the new website LexiconOfSong.org, and the reborn site PortableWisdom.org. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
			&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a lot lately about human tribes. And all of these works make good points about our basic need to be part of a small, supportive community. But here&amp;#8217;s one observation that seems to me to be getting too little consideration, among all this interest in early human tribes: We modern humans are multi-tribal. That is, we tend to belong to, not one, but to many tribes. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Along with many others, of course, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the abortion issue of late.  And I&amp;#8217;m reminded of the classic album by Graham Parker, &lt;em&gt;Squeezing Out Sparks&lt;/em&gt;, as well as other personal and cultural reference points. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As was true for Irish poet W. B. Yeats a century ago, we seem to be watching things fall apart, without a dynamic center to hold us together, and with the monsters  at our door: are we willing to do anything about it? &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about this song by Robert Earl Keen first recorded by Joe Ely for his &lt;em&gt;Love and Danger&lt;/em&gt; album, released in 1992. This is a song about the importance of showing care to others, through our words and our deeds. And about the implacable consequences of failures to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Back on 7 Apr 2021 I wrote a piece titled &amp;#8220;The Decline of the Republican Party - First Gradually and then Suddenly.&amp;#8221; Well, for those who haven&amp;#8217;t been paying attention lately, the &lt;em&gt;suddenly&lt;/em&gt; part has now finally arrived. So what will the Republicans do now? They face a number of significant challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a little while since I&amp;#8217;ve posted anything from The Practical Utopian, so I thought it might be time to give everyone an update on what I&amp;#8217;ve been up to over the last couple of months, including: updates to my Mac App Notenik, the new website LexiconOfSong.org, and the reborn site PortableWisdom.org. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a lot lately about human tribes. And all of these works make good points about our basic need to be part of a small, supportive community. But here&amp;#8217;s one observation that seems to me to be getting too little consideration, among all this interest in early human tribes: We modern humans are multi-tribal. That is, we tend to belong to, not one, but to many tribes. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Along with many others, of course, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the abortion issue of late.  And I&amp;#8217;m reminded of the classic album by Graham Parker, &lt;em&gt;Squeezing Out Sparks&lt;/em&gt;, as well as other personal and cultural reference points. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As was true for Irish poet W. B. Yeats a century ago, we seem to be watching things fall apart, without a dynamic center to hold us together, and with the monsters  at our door: are we willing to do anything about it? &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Popping the Hood with the Notenik App</title>

			&lt;p&gt;My dad was a mechanical engineer. His first car was a Ford of some ancient vintage, and he grew up working on engines, knowing he could always &amp;#8220;pop the hood&amp;#8221; to see what was going on underneath, and adjust it if necessary. But the trend in most modern app development is to discourage hood popping. That&amp;#8217;s where Notenik is different. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of language as playground again this week while listening to Delbert McClinton’s latest album, &lt;em&gt;Outdated Emotion&lt;/em&gt;. The work consists primarily of covers of material that Delbert learned to love while growing up, and I was already familiar with many of them, but one in particular caught my ear, called “Setting’ The Woods on Fire.” &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If execs cannot mandate the same corporate attire for everyone, what makes them think that mandating a certain number of days per week in the office is a good thing? The same flaw lurks in both approaches: every employee is not the same. Every situation is not the same. Every team is not the same. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Every state will once again be empowered to set its own rules on abortion, and we will have taken one more step away from the United States of America, and towards the disjointed, discombobulated, and largely autonomous fifty states of middle North America. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Autocracy may sometimes sound like an easy, neat, plausible solution to all of our current problems. Unfortunately, in actual practice, it doesn&amp;#8217;t generally work out so well. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The common thread running through these three incidents is this particularly American problem we seem to have that a black male, no matter what his achievements, no matter how far he has come, will never quite be able to enjoy the degree of respect that he has legitimately earned. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Of all human activities, war is the one that has the most catastrophic short-term effects. As someone who knew what he was talking about once said: &amp;#8220;War is hell.&amp;#8221; Which means that, when one nation goes to war against another,  someone in power has judged that there are much more consequential long-term benefits to be gained. So what will be the outcomes of this war that Russia has launched against Ukraine? &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve probably heard a bit in the news lately about Spotify, Neil Young, Joe Rogan and Brené Brown. But what are the real issues at stake in this evolving controversy? Censorship? Greed? Free Speech? Big Tech? Let me break it down for you. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time for a new party that is explicitly centrist, and explicitly denounces extremism at both ends of our political spectrum. Creating such a new party will no doubt be a large and expensive  and difficult enterprise, fraught with challenges, but I don&amp;#8217;t believe any better choices are left to us. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;To beat Ohio State at football is a terribly hard thing to do. That&amp;#8217;s the way it&amp;#8217;s been for over a hundred years. And that&amp;#8217;s the way it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be. It&amp;#8217;s not supposed to be easy. The outcome is never certain. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I can remember with wonderful clarity the evening when I received my LSAT scores in the mail. I had recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in English – after switching majors from Engineering a year or so into my academic career – and was living with my father and his second wife in Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;

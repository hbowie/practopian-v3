To realize our potential as human beings, we must acknowledge that we are composed of two very different sides. In order to be whole, we must fully accept both of them.

A large part of who we are, as human beings, consists of patterns on top of patterns. Starting at the subatomic level, there are certain patterns to our existence that are shared by all things in the universe: the basic sub-atomic particles. At a higher level, there are other patterns that define the different elements, and different molecules made from those elements. At a higher level still, there is a cellular structure shared by all living organisms. Other patterns are shared genetically only among the vertebrates. Still others are only present in the primate family. Others are unique to our particular species. Others are a unique part of our individual genetic makeup. All of these patterns --- ways in which our cells multiply and divide, the ways our organs work, the ways we procreate and reproduce --- are stored in our genes.

Many other patterns, though, exist as part of our culture, and not part of our physical constitution. How we communicate, how we learn, how we relate to other members of our species --- all of these patterns are embedded in what we call our culture.

Other patterns exist within individuals, in the form of personality traits, habitual actions, and personal beliefs. 

It is important to realize that part of what makes these things "patterns" is their tendency towards recurrence. These patterns tend to repeat themselves. The most basic patterns are the most sturdy, and the most difficult to change. Higher levels, though, have their own forms of persistence. Like gyroscopes, our repeating personal and cultural patterns lend stability and structure to our lives. We may sometimes rashly wish that we could wake the next morning to find ourselves "a different person." The truth, though, is that life as we know it (and even as we can imagine it) would be impossible if we all did that every morning. 

In the same way, and for the same reasons, our common culture often exhibits resistance to change. And while this resistance may prove frustrating at times, it is again what allows us to experience a cultural identity, and some measure of cultural stability.

It is essential to realize that all these patterns help define who we are. I sometimes hear people affirm that they are going to "drop all their patterns," meaning that they want to stop acting in some non-constructive but habitual fashion. Luckily for them, they are not able to achieve their stated objective --- if they could, they would disappear faster than the Wicked Witch of the West when Dorothy dumped a pail of water on her. For without many layers of interlocking patterns, we would have no existence at all. In a sense, then, we are these patterns.

At the same time, though, we have evolved to the point at which we can consciously change and create many of these patterns. The entire "Self Help" movement can be seen as a means towards helping people change their personal patterns. The "New Age" movement can be seen as the first fumbling steps towards changing many of our shared cultural patterns. Although these patterns are often difficult to modify, we are beginning to prove that we can consciously change them.

Our human identity then, is two-sided. In one sense, we are a collection of recurring patterns. In another sense, we ourselves are the creators of those patterns. 

At all times, then, we must remain conscious of our dual identity: as a collection of particular patterns, and as the creators of those patterns. To pretend that we are one or the other exclusively is to cripple ourselves. If we view ourselves solely as patterns, then we become rigid objects, and necessarily view the act of creation as going on somewhere outside ourselves. If we view ourselves solely as creators, then we become disembodied ghosts, mythical creatures of "pure essence." Both views are equally one-sided and distorted. 

We are both creators and created.

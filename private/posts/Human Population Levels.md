Thinking broadly about the vectors of change currently having an impact on our the material quality of life for humanity, it seems to me that there are essentially five. 

1. Improving Technology

    Constantly improving technology allows humanity to produce new and improved goods and services, and to produce existing ones with ever greater efficiency. 

2. Increasing Human Population Levels

    Human population levels continue to increase, with no expectation that the growth rate will level out any time in the near future. 

3. Increasing Resource Utilization per Capita

    As more and more humans become part of industrialized society, their standards of living increase, but so do the quantities of natural resources used by each person. 

4. Depletion of Global Natural Resources

    Global supplies of clean air, fresh water and non-renewable energy  sources are declining. 

5. Growing Quantities of Pollution

    Human and industrial waste products are increasingly contaminating and polluting our natural environments.

## Our Evolving Culture Crisis

We have seen that humanity is greatly defined by its culture, and that our culture is itself a product of its own sort of evolution. 

In our modern society, cultural evolution has been driven by two primary forces: technology and capitalism. Our technological capabilities have been evolving so quickly that they have driven many other aspects of our culture. Television, for example, has had a huge impact on all aspects of modern culture, as it has become a primary medium for communication and entertainment. 

The other driving force has been capitalism: the impulse to make money, and to amass wealth. Capitalism and socialism competed with each other on a global scale for many years. With the fall of the Soviet Union, however, capitalism seems to have emerged as the victor, proving itself better equipped to adapt to changing conditions in the global economic environment. 

These two forces --- technology and capitalism --- can be seen to be dominant ones precisely because the conditions necessary for evolution have been allowed to exist in their respective fields. The scientific method allows different theories to compete strenuously in their predictive powers. Those that fail to compete successfully are mercilessly weeded out. Different products of technology compete with one another, primarily through the mechanisms of capitalism. Superior designs drive inferior ones from the marketplace, and spawn continually newer models.

The same conditions necessary for evolution can be found in the field of economics. In modern capitalistic societies, corporations are the competing organisms. They continually strive for improved competitive position, and ruthlessly drive their weaker opponents from the field of battle.

Evolution has proven to be an effective mechanism for progressive change in the fields of technology and economics. The unbridled impact of these two forces, however, has produced an unprecedented crisis in our cultural development. Many aspects of our culture have been adversely affected by the relentless evolution of these two forces. It is not that progress in these two fields has itself been bad, but that we have no other means for controlling the impact of these forces on other areas of our cultural life. 

Evidence of this culture crisis can be seen in many aspects of our modern life. Almost every group in the world seems to be trying to hold on to its indigenous culture, against the eroding onslaught of technology and capitalism. With no other vehicles for controlling our cultural evolution, voters seem intent on holding politicians increasingly responsible for cultural issues. Candidates are chosen based on their adherence to, and de-fense of, "family values," even though our political institutions offer no means for dealing with such cultural issues. Members of our society turn to religions, with all their primitive superstitions and illogical beliefs, simply because they offer a way to cling to sets of values determined by something other than short-term economic utility. 

Taken together, this collection of symptoms justifies an alarming diagnosis. Our collective culture is out of control. It is changing rapidly, in many ways for the worse. Traditional cultural institutions have not been able to withstand the allied forces of technology and economics. Some of the results are increasing drug use, increasing crime, environmental destruction, and increasing levels of personal frustration, depression and anxiety. 

But there is worse news. Human culture is becoming increasingly homogenous. We have become, in Marshall McLuhanâ€™s words, a "global village."
  
From an evolutionary perspective, this is a disastrous development. Evolution is a blind process. It creates progress only through a process of random variation, with failures weeded out by competition. It can be viewed as intelligent and purposeful over the long term only if we ignore all the failures, and look only at what finally emerges victorious. In the short term, evolution is much more likely to create interesting failures than startling new successes.

However, since we have created, in many respects, a single human culture, we can no longer afford failure! If we had multiple cultures, then we could afford to let evolution stumble blindly along, knowing that some of these cultures would fail miserably, but that other superior ones would eventually win out. 

We have now put all our eggs in one basket, though. If it is true that technology and capitalism are succeeding in the short run, but also creating side-effects that will be disastrous in the longer run, then we cannot trust to survival of the fittest. If our single human culture proves to be a failure, then it will take all of us down with it.

We have allowed our culture to evolve naturally up to this point. We have considered only two alternatives: either accept our current culture as it is, or retreat to the past, defending traditional values. Neither approach is working. 

Traditional values are inevitably eroding, and modern culture is being blindly driven towards values of greed, power and survival. 

To find a way out of this dead end, we must consider a third alternative. We cannot cling helplessly to traditional values that will inevitably change. But neither can we afford to continue to let our culture evolve naturally. Instead, we must take the reins ourselves. We must create our own culture, with our only consideration being to consciously create a future that we want for ourselves.

## At the Crossroads

Planet earth is now at a unique point in its 4.6 billion year history. We are at a cusp, a turning point, a crossroads. 
For centuries, humanity has pondered the questions of where we have come from, and of who or what created us. Our species has created a variety of stories to explain our origins. We collectively imagined that we were created all at once, essentially as we are today, a mere few thousand years ago. 

It turns out, though, that none of those creation stories were true. Instead, we slowly and continually evolved over a time scale of billions of years. If we heed the wisdom of modern biology, we must accept that we are the products of evolution. We were created, not by gods that looked like us, but by a mindless process. By dumb luck, if you will. We just happened. 

What then, is the meaning of all of these stories we fabricated, all these gods that various cultures have seen as our creators? If we are honest with ourselves, then we must accept that these have simply been projections of our uniquely human nature. The gods are not out there, but in here. These innumerable myths are valuable and true when seen as reflections of our own nature, but meaningless when it comes to explaining or describing our external reality.

After many years of ignorance and confusion, we now know how we got here. Evolution brought us to this point in history. Survival of the fittest, and all the rest. Evolution has been working tirelessly on this planet for over three billion years, and has finally produced a species that has become conscious of this process.
 
Two paths now stretch out in front of us. On one, we continue to be carried along by the mindless process of evolution. Since humanity has now reached a point at which we have circumvented and undermined many of the basic mechanisms of this process, this path is ultimately a dead end. If we continue to multiply mindlessly, without competition from other species, then we will undoubtedly evolve into our own worst enemy. Because, to continue along the path of evolution, we need enemies. Our human population will continue to grow beyond any point at which we can sustain even the minimum requirements for life, let alone any significant quality of life. If we do not make the quantum leap completely away from evolution, then this process will inexorably pull us back down into it. If we do not rise above our history, then we will be immersed once again in the endless struggle for survival.

The other path is one of conscious creation. We have imagined for millennia that someone else has been driving the bus. We know now that it has been stuck on a kind of auto-pilot --- there has been no one behind the wheel. Until we knew the truth, we had no real choice except to continue to be swept along by evolution. We now, for the first time in the history of the planet, have a different choice. We can take the wheel. And we can chart our own course. There are no road maps, or even any roads --- not even any destinations waiting ahead. To take this path, we must truly be willing to be pioneers, to explore, to blaze our own trails. We must be willing to decide, individually and collectively, where we want to go, and what we want our futures to look like. 

We have imagined that our destiny was being guided by a wise intelligence that knew better than we where to go. We know now that our destiny was formed by a blind process of evolution. As unwise as we know we often are, we must now face the reality that there is no one better qualified to lead us farther down the road. There is no greater intelligence, no greater wisdom, no divine hand to guide us. We have only ourselves to rely on. 

To take this second path, though, we must be willing to step out of our past, to shed it like the confining cocoon it has been. One life has brought us to this point. That life has included the evolutionary struggle for survival, and sets of superstitious belief systems that have been products of our cultural evolution. We must be willing to shed these completely, in order to grasp this opportunity to seat ourselves behind the wheel of our own destiny. If we take this path, then where we are going will not look much like where we have been. To get there, we must be willing to question all the assumptions that have formed the baggage of our cultural ancestry.

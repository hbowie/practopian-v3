## Introduction

Much of my time I'm engaged with friends, family members, coworkers and strangers in working out the transactional details of our lives together: dates, times, places, finances, and all the rest. 

On a fairly regular basis, though, our conversations veer into very different territory, and we begin to talk passionately about current affairs and possible futures, how we think the world ought to be, our varied theories about why the world is the way it is, and what ought to be done about it. 

When we enter this space, however, we quickly run up against differences in our fundamental beliefs about the way the world works, and what's most important to us.  And that's where we seem to run aground. 

Of course, we all bring different belief systems to the table in these conversations. Where do these systems of belief come from? It's hard to tell sometimes. Listen to people talk and they will cite religious, ethnic, national, cultural and family sources for their beliefs, and yet it is hard to find two individuals -- even with common religions and backgrounds -- who seem to believe the same things. 

However dubious their heritages, though, we defend our particular sets of opinions with passionate fervor, knowing somehow that these fundamental beliefs form the very core of our existence, and that to surrender even one of them would compromise our identity, our sense of who we are. 

Time after time, following these conversations, I find myself wondering why we have such hard times converging our most important beliefs into a common set, why it's so hard to define a shared belief system that will allow us to move forward together without becoming entangled in differences of opinion on fundamental issues. *Come on*, I think. *How hard can this be?*

And so, after asking this question so many times, I have decided to strike out on a course that will attempt to provide an answer to this question. 

And so we have this book/organization, which will attempt to define a common belief system that can be shared by friends and family, coworkers and strangers.

To develop and promote a belief system that is:

* based on a modern understanding of reality; 
* designed to foster the well-being of current and future generations of human beings;
* intended to guide and encourage the continued progression of human culture;
* can serve in some sense as an "open source religion" -- a set of foundational beliefs and values that are open to continued input and evolution.

*The Practical Utopian* is an evolving set of writings describing a particular approach to the human condition. *Practopian* is a convenient contraction, and the published writings are available at [Practopian.org](http://www.practopian.org), while the source materials are available at [github.com/hbowie/practopian](https://github.com/hbowie/practopian).

The core tenets of this philosophy are as follows:

* Our interests are global in scope; that is, while we also recognize the importance of local and national perspectives, we are not interested in simply pushing problems from one part of the globe to another -- we are interested in the condition of the world as a whole. 

* Our interests are long-term; that is, while we also recognize the importance of the here and now, and the importance of short-term results, we are ultimately focused on global conditions as we can expect them to evolve into the future, certainly beyond our own life spans. 

* Our perspective is a human one; that is, while we are concerned about the conditions and fates of other species as well, our values are ultimately rooted in a concern for the human condition. 

* We embrace science; we do not see the scientific method, or modern scientific beliefs, as posing any fundamental contradiction to any other elements of our beliefs. 

* We embrace the inner realities of human existence; that is, while we are comfortable taking an external, objective, view of reality, we are also comfortable considering an inner, subjective view of that same reality. 

* We care about outcomes; what happens matter to us, and we believe that some outcomes are better than others. 

* We believe that our actions, both individually and collectively, can influence those outcomes. 

* In order to advance our interests, we neither place our trust in, nor relinquish our responsibilities to, any non-human agent, whether such an agent be called God, Evolution, or any other name. 

* We believe that our culture is malleable; that is, while our shared beliefs, values and practices provide a framework in which we operate, our culture is also ultimately a human construct that we can shape in order to produce better outcomes for humanity in the future.

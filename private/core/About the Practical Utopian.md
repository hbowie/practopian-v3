# About the Practical Utopian

For about as much of my life as I can remember I have felt a strong sense of idealism combined with a pragmatic grounding in reality. Hence the name of my philosophical blog: the Practical Utopian, or Practopian, for short. 

While the posts on this site are written as the ideas occur to me, I believe they do tie together into a logical progression, which does not always match the sequence in which they were written. And so I here present them in the most logical sequence, for those approaching the site for the first time. 

* [The Four Quadrants of Human Knowledge](http://www.practopian.org/posts/the-four-quadrants-of-human-knowledge.html)
* [Developmental Levels](http://www.practopian.org/posts/developmental-levels.html)
* [Human Nature](http://www.practopian.org/posts/human-nature.html)
* [Reasons for Belief](http://www.practopian.org/posts/reasons-for-belief.html)
* [The Nature of God](http://www.practopian.org/posts/the-nature-of-god.html)
* [Religious Freedom](http://www.practopian.org/posts/religious-freedom.html)
* [Religion, Storytelling and Art](http://www.practopian.org/posts/religion-storytelling-and-art.html)
* [The Systemic Era](http://www.practopian.org/posts/the-systemic-era.html)

I hope you find the content here to be helpful and inspiring. 

(And thanks to [Scafuri Bakery](http://scafuribakery.com) in Chicago for letting me borrow a photo of some of their offerings to use as a graphic for the site: to enjoy their baked goods with a cup of coffee may not be heaven on earth to some people, but it's certainly close enough for me every once in a while.)

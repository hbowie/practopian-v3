		content: "Suffering through a pandemic is a terrible way to have to learn a lesson or two about the nature of humanity But it s what we have so we may as well make use of it What can we learn from our current crisis Not so much in the I should have stocked up on more toilet paper vein but in terms of understanding more about who we are and our place in the universe You know big picture stuff Here are my thoughts 1 Normalcy is an illusion Still thinking that conditions prior to the pandemic were the way things were supposed to be Or that once this thing is over we ll all go back to normal Give it up We ll adapt we ll get by the best we can because that s what we humans do But there is no special state that represents the way things are supposed to be there s just the way things are As Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari put it ynh > The heated debates about Homo Sapiens natural way of life miss the main point Ever since the Cognitive Revolution there hasn t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens There are only cultural choices from among a bewildering palette of possibilities 2 We humans don t occupy any particular place of privilege in this world One day we re feeling like the Crown of Creation The next day we re getting our butts kicked by a submicroscopic infectious agent that s not really even alive and certainly not conscious So if we think we re something special and somehow chosen or destined to ride herd on the rest of the world it would be best to think again I m reminded of some rather obscure song lyrics from an old Jefferson Airplane song ebd > Consider how small you are > Say it plainly > The human name > Doesn t mean shit to a tree or to a novel coronavirus as it turns out 3 Although each of us likes to think of ourselves as powerful independent agents the truth is somewhat different Is there something ironic about all of us sitting quietly at home streaming shows and movies often showing strong heroes conquering evil villains I think so When confronted with a real threat to humanity it s interesting that our ace superpowers turn out to be sheltering in place social distancing and ordering things to be delivered Who would have guessed 4 We are already a global society This is not to suggest that we are ready to do away with national governments or with national borders these things generally serve useful purposes And it s not to argue that we should be indiscriminate about our international trading partners On the other hand the rate at which this novel coronavirus spread around the world and our inability to contain it and the effects it has had on global supply chains should tell us something we are all one human family all connected in ways we cannot see and all interdependent As Martin Luther King Jr once wrote mlk We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny If we were harboring any illusions otherwise then our current situation should be enough to dispel those fitful dreams 5 Just because you can t see a thing and don t understand it and don t want to believe it doesn t mean it won t kill you Overpopulation global warming species extinction these are all as real as COVID 19 and even more serious threats in the slightly longer run Greta Thunberg gt has been telling all of us to listen to the scientists and the pandemic has brought those people back to the forefront of our attention as we come to realize that none of us individually has any sure fire way of defeating this thing but that scientists around the world working together and sharing information with one another may just come up with a vaccine and or a cure 6 It might be time to rethink our policy of infinite growth Let s see how can I put this delicately There are so many people now in so many places that our political leaders had to issue stay at home orders because whenever we re allowed to go outside we tend to congregate in such large numbers and in such close quarters that we re a danger to one another And the virus has hit us hardest in large urban areas not to mention cruise ships where population densities are the greatest And then the fallout from the pandemic has revealed the fragility of our global supply chains and the holes in our safety nets Do we really think it s a good idea to keep adding more and more people to the planet and packing us together in ever tighter quarters And to continue pushing the limits of how many humans one planet can support Might be time to reconsider this whole idea of endless human population growth pop 7 It s high time we figure out how to better run large organizations One of the most consistent elements of our current culture is our pervasive mistrust of large organizations Despite all the things we disagree about there is one attitude we all share we don t trust large organizations any farther than we can throw them On the left this generally manifests as a lack of faith in big business on the right this tends to show up as a distrust of big government But the overall feeling is the same a sense that these organizations are too large too complex too opaque and too independent from the will of the those they are ostensibly in place to serve We all like small We trust small The problem is that humanity is now a sprawling mass of almost 8 billion people facing global problems and small is just not going to cut it So we had better get serious about making large organizations more effective and more responsive to our common human needs 8 Our purpose here on earth is to care for one another As we consider our current situation we may begin to question whether there is any purpose to our existence We may begin to ask questions such as Why are we here What sense does all of this make If there s no grand design then just what is the point But when we scrape away all of the fading illusions we are left with one bedrock reality that won t go away even if we matter to nothing or no one else we matter to each other As Albert Einstein said ae2 > How strange is the lot of us mortals Each of us is here for a brief sojourn for what purpose he knows not though he sometimes thinks he senses it But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people first of all for those upon whose smiles and well being our own happiness is wholly dependent and then for the many unknown to us to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men and women living and dead and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving This pandemic has made all of us more aware of the countless number of others whose daily labors make it possible for each of us to go on with our lives each day if we take away nothing else from this thing let s remember that in one way or another we are all here to take care of one another and that so long as we re doing that we have purpose enough ae1 https en wikipedia org wiki Albert Einstein ae2 https history aip org history exhibits einstein essay htm ebd

		content: "As children our thoughts about death are stuff of dreams and fairy tales As adults we learn to suppress these thoughts because we are busy getting on with things But as teenagers in this transition between nursery rhymes and real life we tend to approach this topic with a frankness and curiosity that can be somewhat startling Laura Nyro wrote her song And When I Die apple at the age of 17 and her refreshing treatment of the subject shows none of the reverence or piety that we learn to adopt as adults Let s look over her lyrics > And when I die and when I m dead dead and gone > There ll be one child born and a world to carry on to carry on > > I m not scared of dying and I don t really care > If it s peace you find in dying well then let the time be near > If it s peace you find in dying when dying time is here > Just bundle up my coffin cause it s cold way down there > I hear that s it s cold way down there yeah crazy cold way down there > > And when I die and when I m gone > There ll be one child born and a world to carry on to carry on > > My troubles are many they re as deep as a well > I can swear there ain t no heaven but I pray there ain t no hell > Swear there ain t no heaven and pray there ain t no hell > But I ll never know by living only my dying will tell > Only my dying will tell yeah only my dying will tell > > And when I die and when I m gone > There ll be one child born and a world to carry on to carry on > > Give me my freedom for as long as I be > All I ask of living is to have no chains on me > All I ask of living is to have no chains on me > And all I ask of dying is to go naturally only want to go naturally > Don t want to go by the devil don t want to go by the demon > Don t want to go by Satan don t want to die uneasy > Just let me go naturally > > And when I die and when I m gone > There ll be one child born there ll be one child born > When I die there ll be one child born > When I die there ll be one child born > When I die there ll be one child born > When I die there ll be one child born This song engendered lots of popular cover versions but Nyro s own recording apple is the unalloyed master from which all of the imperfect copies were made Unlike some singer songwriters of the sixties Nyro s voice singing playing and arrangements were more than the equal of those who popularized her songs and there s really no reason to seek them out until you ve fully absorbed Nyro s own version The music starts off in a dirge like vein appropriate for a funeral but then quickly shifts into an uptempo treatment full of liveliness and vitality with Nyro s voice alternately swooping and confiding shivering and shouting husky and full throated making it clear that despite her topic rigor mortis is nowhere near It s easy to underestimate Nyro s achievement here especially in light of all the unavoidable cover versions of the song that tend to somewhat muddy the song s impact One can easily view this as sort of a youthful exploration of Nyro s many emerging talents but lacking any special coherence For me though this is an amazingly mature and prescient song for Nyro to have recorded in 1967 Think of it as a modern humanistic companion to John Donne s famous sonnet Death be not proud https www poets org poetsorg poem death be not proud holy sonnet 10 whereas Donne was reflecting on a supposed eternal life Nyro makes the following points Death is a natural physical event not a metaphysical one Death deserves and will receive from her no special reverence She has no interest in debating the existence of an afterlife She s happy to let others adopt whatever attitudes towards death they may prefer All she asks is freedom to live and die by her own lights If there is some sort of continuance of her own life after death then it will take the form not of some otherworldly existence but of one child born and a world to carry on And then to have wrapped all of these striking insights into a dizzying horn soaked uplifting musical performance that leaves listeners happily humming along and tapping their feet and that gets off the stage in roughly two and a half minutes it s a remarkably mature and sophisticated achievement for an artist of any age We might be tempted to think that these apparently humanistic themes in her song were merely accidental or incidental to her motivations to write a hit song but then Wikipedia informs us pedia that Nyro credited the Sunday school at the New York Society for Ethical Culture enyc with providing the basis of her education This institution was and still is associated with a branch of humanism that maintains the importance of congregational structures and so adopted many of the practices of traditional religions but without a belief in any sort of god It may be helpful as well to note that Nyro s later life and death did indeed mirror her words in this song You can read more on Wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki Laura Nyro apple https

		content: "No matter what your age or orientation political or otherwise it s hard to gainsay the significance of humankind s first trip through space to set foot on a celestial body other than our birth planet Of course fictional space flight has become so common in books and video that sitting down for two hours to watch a documentary about a real trip that took place half a century ago might seem like a somewhat pedestrian enterprise Ah but don t be fooled Like the mission itself the film is the work of supreme technicians who understand that the reward for dedication to their craft their mission and their colleagues is the accomplishment of some high achievement that no one of them could possibly have realized on their own If there is a central tragedy at the heart of most contemporary filmmaking it is this that so many people work so seamlessly together applying such high levels of technical skill to create astonishing sequences of special effects only to tell us one more story about some isolated loner seeking some combination of money glory or revenge and so the stories oft told by such films are frank betrayals of the realities of how these movies actually get made Apollo 11 is completely different It shows us the gradual measured unfolding of a true story about a real accomplishment And in each loving frame it reveals the truth of what actually happened and how such achievements are possible And what it shows us is nothing like what we see in most fiction and nothing like what we too often see in society around us today Instead here s what we are privileged to observe A vast team of dedicated professionals all bent towards a singular purpose People with the vision patience and persistence to focus on a common mission that will take a decade or more to complete People who understand that important work requires sustained and focused effort over long periods of time Adults who understand that moments of high drama are not the things they live for but are indications that something has gone wrong that some mistake has been made and must be quickly evaluated and if necessary corrected An undertaking funded and led by our US government that brings together all American citizens as well as others all over the globe in appreciation and support of a single common goal Levels of trust in one another that seem almost unimaginable today especially in any sphere of public enterprise Degrees of common civility and assumed professionalism that underpin that trust People who live every day of their lives by the credo that actions and results are more important than words who have no need of or patience for posturing or grandstanding A Republican president continuing a mission launched by a Democratic predecessor and selflessly congratulating participants on the mission s success And perhaps most compellingly we see three ordinary Americans with wives and families and professional careers willingly and knowingly embarking on a journey that has never been taken before a trip that step by step stage by stage mile by mile hurls them ever farther from everything and everyone they have ever known into an alien and unforgiving environment and to a destination so remote that they are completely beyond any possible help or rescue should the slightest element of their mission go wrong and we see them taking this journey and completing it successfully without the slightest hesitation and with an unwavering and steadfast humanity as well as faith in the shared humanity of others It s hard to imagine finding two hours of cinema that could prove more instructive or enlightening in 2019 or perhaps in any year And don t let the understated style of filmmaking here lull you into the belief that nothing of significance is going on in truth the slow measured taut presentation of the film is a reflection of the very characteristics of the mission it is documenting and the adventurers it depicts The style of the film is simply a perfectly appropriate extension of its subject matter and a way for the moviemakers to instruct us not just by what they show us but by how it is shown I ve been reading This View of Life Completing the Darwinian Revolution view by David Sloan Wilson of late and I can recommend this illuminating book as the perfect companion to Apollo 11 Wilson explains patiently and convincingly how we humans are the products for better or for worse of our collective cultural evolution He also talks about how we humans have the ability to work together seamlessly to form large and capable societies as well as the ways in which those societies can break down and what we must do to rebuild them For anyone who sincerely wishes to make America great again or indeed to undertake and sustain any complex demanding but worthwhile human enterprise Apollo 11 provides an essential and convincing view of how such things are really done a11 https en wikipedia org wiki Apollo 11 2019 film view https amzn to 2Y5lz4i"

		title: "Are Political Parties Doing Us More Harm Than Good",
		date: "25 Jun 2021",
    url: "blog/hbowie/are-political-parties-doing-us-more-harm-than-good.html",
		content: "I ve been making the case lately that the Republican Party is in decline decline and needs to reinvent itself where But perhaps something even more radical is needed For when we look at the current state of our two party system in the US nothing about it makes any sense Here in Seattle where I live our mayor has announced that the current term will be her last and so we have a whole host of new faces appearing in our primary the results of which will determine the two candidates who will be competing for the mayoral seat in the fall But neither of them will be a Republican This is because our parties have largely divvied up our national electorate along the urban rural divide city which means that a Republican mayor in one our big cities is about as likely as a snowball fight in Florida on the Fourth of July Here in the state of Washington starting in 2008 we have what are known as Top 2 primaries top2 meaning that the two candidates receiving the most votes in a primary move on to the general election no matter what their party affiliation or lack thereof This innovative approach to our elections was of course not advanced by either of our parties but was brought forward and made into law through our initiative process and approved by almost 60 of the voters What this means is that neither the candidates nor the journalists nor the voters can simply check the usual boxes and mail in their efforts we all have to start at ground zero and evaluate issues and candidates without relying on rote party characterizations and preferences and affiliations Which arguably results in a better informed electorate and a more meaningful democratic process And so what exactly are the Democrats and Republicans good for Both of our modern parties are charter members of the mutual vilification society in which they spend vast sums of money in order to raise more money in order to fund marketing campaigns based not on the most accurate and pertinent facts but on fine judgments of which attacks on which opponents will be most likely to motivate their members to dig ever deeper into their pockets and perhaps even to show up at the polls on election day And the result of all of this frenzied partisan activity Is anyone educated in the process Does anyone become smarter or better informed I think not Probably the most predictable result is that citizens lose faith in their governments govtrust and increasing numbers of voters become not just undecided but disenchanted with our entire political process 2party Is it any wonder We have one of our parties largely representing urban and suburban voters and encouraging them to vilify their country cousins as unsophisticated hicks and another party representing the more sparsely populated regions of our country and encouraging them to think of their cousins in the city as mad socialists marching for blood in the streets I m sure these depictions benefit someone but I find it hard to believe they benefit our electorate and and even harder to believe that the net effect is good for our country as a whole So perhaps we shouldn t be surprised to find ourselves living in an increasingly confused and divided country that finds it impossible to come to meaningful grips with any substantive issues And we can thank both of our political parties for this sorry state of affairs It is telling that some of our most compelling national figures of late Donald Trump on the right and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez on the left have risen to elected office not through the channels of their respective parties but despite the best efforts of the party machinery to promote more traditional candidates Our media landscape has also been neatly divided along these same lines Because the news outlets like the parties need steady infusions of cash and the most reliable way to generate page views is to pit one side against the other in the most derisive fashion possible If you doubt this proposition I submit Frank Bruni s final column for the New York Times bruni to you as substantiation Part of the problem I m convinced is that the traditional alignment of our parties around the labels of conservative and progressive is not very helpful As G K Chesterton observed almost one hundred years ago conpro > The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected And while these words sound like they might have been meant as a depiction of comic extremes when we examine some of our current controversies Chesterton s words seem eerily prescient For example look at current debates about excessive use of force by police especially against people of color One side talks of defunding the police while the other staunchly defends our boys in blue as universal saviors who are beyond reproach And so any more nuanced discussions say of the perhaps excessive power and influence amassed by police unions and the increasing militarization of our police and the decreasing funding for social services all seem to get lost in the noise generated by the faux debate between the two equally senseless extremes But perhaps more to the point in our current era the third decade of the 21st century doesn t seem like an especially good time to center every discussion around the issue of conservative vs progressive Our modern world is facing a growing array of novel and challenging problems that will require measured innovation and creative partnerships between government and industry and as we confront these challenges the traditional political talking points socialism vs capitalism Christianity vs other beliefs foreign affairs vs domestic public investment vs tax cuts all seem increasingly like baggage that is slowing us down and preventing us from actually dealing with the important stuff So what is the solution Some are tempted to argue for a more centrist approach but I think the fate of Howard Schulz s stillborn 2020 presidential campaign centrist should serve as a cautionary warning about the growing irrelevance of conservative and progressive as defining labels the judgment of voters seemed to be that if the best you can do is define your position as being midway between these two traditional poles then you must be even less relevant than either extreme which puts you so far down the list that you have no business even running No what I think we need are more independent problem solvers focused on helping our entire nation In some ways I think both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden can serve as useful templates Bernie ran for president in the Democratic primaries in 2020 but he has historically defined himself as an independent in the Senate and has avoided any sort of strict allegiance to party leadership And although Biden may at first appear to be an odd choice to pair with Sanders in this regard I include him because of the following characteristics + his avoidance of strict adherence to any sort of progressive orthodoxy + his consistent emphasis on the need for government to deliver real solutions to real problems for real people + his stated and demonstrated desire to find common ground among a variety of perspectives rather than using every issue as a new opportunity for political posturing In the past our two party system has helped to assure that our governments consider diverse viewpoints before forging compromise solutions that deliver optimal benefits to our country as a whole But in our modern world of novel problems industrial scale fundraising out of control social media 24 hour news cycles and growing urbanization our political parties seem to be doing little to educate or unify us and instead seem to be doing all they can to spread disinformation and further divide our already fractured society Let s all do everything we can to dive to the core of complex issues and seek out honest and authentic candidates who are focused on the hard work of governing rather than the cheap thrills of seeking out their next soundbites so that they can gain a few more minutes in the national spotlight It s hard work but it s the work that needs to be done 2party https news gallup com poll 329639 support third political party high point aspx

		title: "Art and the Eye of the Beholder",
		date: "15 Nov 2017",
    url: "blog/hbowie/art-and-the-eye-of-the-beholder.html",
		content: "I ve noticed that Big Thinkers people like Ken Wilber kw and Yuval Noah Harari ynh tend to get confused about art and why it matters Unable to find a neat place for it in their developmental models of civilization they end up citing that old chestnut of Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and leaving it at that as an entirely subjective experience Everyone s idea of beauty can be different they say and they re all equally valid Whatever floats your boat So now let s stop gibbering about art and move on to more important topics Of course I ve never run across an actual artist who sees things this way Let me recount what seems to me to be the complete artistic process 1 A prospective artist learns some craft that allows them to manipulate images sounds or words in a way that is appealing to others They often learn this craft by emulating other artists who have come before them 2 The artist s creativity is sparked by some new technique perhaps enabled by an advance in technology 3 The artist has an inner experience about something a feeling a thought an insight or likely some sensation harder to pigeonhole that feels unique to them Insofar as they can tell others around them are not having or have not had this same experience 4 The artist feels a strong desire for expression and communion 5 The artist uses her acquired craft to fashion an object that can be shared with others a painting a song a story or something else that can be observed in some way 6 This object proves to indeed be different from other similar objects 7 Moreover it is different in a way that betrays traces of its authorship A sufficiently informed observer becomes aware that this singular work of art could only have been produced by this particular auteur 8 Contemplation of this object helps to replicate in its audience something of the original inner experience that the artist had back in Step 3 9 As a result of this shared experience observers henceforth live different lives than they would have without this work of art These may be big differences or small differences but they are in some sense important differences And so by the end of this whole cycle what exactly has been accomplished 1 We have had demonstrated for us the value of the individual since what started as a unique experience by a single person has now enriched many 2 We have had demonstrated for us some element of our common humanity for what started as a unique feeling has now been shared with a host of others 3 We have experienced personal growth Individuals who have come under the spell of a particular work are now able to see the world in some new way 4 We have collectively expanded our notion of what it means to be human for by accepting this new object as a work of art we have forever enlarged our definition of the human experience 5 We have taken steps in one way or another to help create a more human world an environment that is more welcoming and more caring for actual human beings So you can see that if my claims are true appreciation of art is much more than the purely subjective experience that some Big Thinkers would portray for us At this point you may well ask my credentials for making such claims I am not of course myself an artist because if I were I would probably be doing these things not talking about how or why they are done But hardly a week goes by without me being on the receiving end of this process in one way or the other Just a few days ago I had the privilege of hearing Sam Bush sb and his Band performing Leon Russell lr s song Stranger in a Strange Land siasl About a month before that I was lucky enough to be in the audience to hear Sarah Jarosz sj performing the Tom Waits tw song Come On Up to the House coutth Something magical happens to me in these moments and I m a changed better person afterwards more alive more connected to others Don t just take my word for it though Fortunately for us some actual artists have spoken on this topic as well Let s see what they have to say For those such as Harari who point to experiments in which computer algorithms have written music that can be confused with the works of Beethoven I would remind them of these words from mystery author Raymond Chandler chandler > There are no vital and significant forms of art there is only art and precious little of that The growth of populations has in no way increased the amount it has merely increased the adeptness with which substitutes can be produced and packaged And for those who think empires can be built on science alone there are these words from poet William Blake blake > The foundation of empire is art and science Remove them or degrade them and the empire is no more Empire follows art and not vice versa as Englishmen suppose Countering the notion that the goal of art is the mere appreciation of beauty author Anthony Burgess has said burgess > The excitement we derive from a work of art is mostly the excitement of seeing connections that did not exist before of seeing quite different aspects of life unified through a pattern And expressing the power of art to improve one s life we have trumpeter Wynton Marsalis marsalis1 > When I started learning about jazz I wasn t into any kind of art I had no idea it could have a practical purpose Now more than thirty years later I testify to the power of art and more specifically jazz to improve your life and keep on improving it And in a similar vein we have author C S Lewis lewis > Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom fully realize the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors We realize it best when we talk with an unliterary friend He may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world In it we should be suffocated The man who is contented to be only himself and therefore less a self is in prison My own eyes are not enough for me I will see through those of others Reality even seen through the eyes of many is not enough I will see what others have invented And Marsalis again marsalis2 talking about the power of the arts to increase our appreciation for humanity > Jazz insists on the undisputed sovereignty of the human being In this technological era we can easily be fooled into believing that sophisticated machines are more important than progressive humanity That s why art is an important barometer of identity The arts let us know who we are in all of our glory reveal the best of who we are All the political and financial might in the world is diminished when put to the service of an impoverished cultural agenda > > We all know that civilization requires a supreme effort Our technology will become outmoded but the technology of the human soul does not change And for those who think that art is a mere adornment the icing on the cake something pleasant but nonessential I ll finish with these words from author Henry Miller miller > Men are not suffering from the lack of good literature good art good theatre good music but from that which has made it impossible for these to become manifest In short they are suffering from the silent shameful conspiracy the more shameful since it is unacknowledged which has bound them together as enemies of art and artist They are suffering from the fact that art is not the primary moving force in their lives They are suffering from the act repeated daily of keeping up the pretense that they can go their way lead their lives without art kw https en wikipedia org wiki Ken Wilber ynh http www ynharari

		content: "As I write these words the invasion of our US Capitol in DC is only a week behind us At least in terms of what I ve been reading abyss and writing coup over the intervening period many of us are wracked anew by the question of how it could have come to this and what these actions might mean for our future In particular many of us are wondering how so many people could have come to believe The Big Lie Under Trump the Lie has taken many forms but by now its general outline is clear Trump is the ultimate winner only he can be trusted and believed all other sources of information and authority are to be treated with utter contempt and so on But now I think it s time to move on to some more urgent questions + How do we end The Big Lie + How do we heal our society + How do we bring our divided citizenry back together around a shared set of beliefs and values And I m reminded of a piece of wisdom from Ken Wilber > I have one major rule Everybody is right More specifically everybody including me has some important pieces of truth and all of those pieces need to be honored cherished and included in a more gracious spacious and compassionate embrace And so I m starting to wonder if we want to end The Big Lie what undisclosed pieces of truth do we need to bring out into the open in order to achieve a more spacious shared understanding of our common reality In other words what is The Big Truth that we have yet to acknowledge And I start with this Our leaders have failed us The core responsibility of leadership as I think we all understand is to ensure the continued survival of the tribe This is why ancient tales of Moses leading his people to the promised land still resonate with us today This is why Britons still revere the memory of Winston Churchill who led their country through the darkest hours of WW II And this is why students of business still analyze the resurrection and resurgence of Apple under the leadership of Steve Jobs This core responsibility of leadership to ensure the survival of the tribe is not carried out through easy decisions and quick wins and short term profits it is not accomplished through routine meeting attendance and delegation it is not fulfilled through the achievement of annual operating goals and the collection of accompanying bonuses rather it is fulfilled through recognition of critical long term goals and the courage to hold one s tribe together and to urge them to do whatever it takes necessary in order to achieve those goals However wherever we sit today and no matter what modern tribe we may be discussing it is all too clear that the only tribe our leaders have been saving is the one made up of the very wealthiest members of society All of us are interested in survival at least for ourselves and our families over the spans of our natural lives and very often also for our children and grandchildren And yet our leaders have fashioned a society in which we all except for the moneyed class have to worry almost continuously about existential threats such as + Job loss due to business downturns + Job loss due to relocation of work + Job loss due to poor leadership decisions + Loss of careers due to changes in technology + Insufficient income to support ourselves in retirement + Loss of homes due to income fluctuations + Inadequate supplies of healthy food and clean water + Global warming + Other forms of environmental collapse and ecological overwhelm And what have our leaders done about any of this At most no matter where we turn whether to business or to the liberals or the conservatives or to religion or to the academics or to the commentators they have made fine speeches and expressed noble intentions but taken little or no action other than to line their own pockets and occasionally throw a few scraps to the rest of us And so if we do not have the leaders we need we must ask ourselves what systems and processes were supposed to produce them and why they have failed Our educational systems have failed us We have been relying primarily on Ivy League colleges and MBA programs to produce society s leaders for us And yet colleges have been slow to adapt to changing conditions and become too focused on serving the moneyed class And MBA programs have focused too tightly on spreadsheets and PowerPoints with the goal of meeting ambitious income and revenue targets for corporations Our business leaders have been taught to serve their corporations abstract theoretical constructs devoid of flesh and blood while ignoring the effects of their decisions on real people And none of these educational institutions have placed sufficient emphasis on enduring human values and society and culture let alone on qualities of leadership How can we expect people to lead their tribes to ongoing survival when they have been taught to only serve the tribe of capitalists existing at the very tops of their corporate hierarchies In researching this piece I had occasion to refer to Dr Martin Luther King Jr s speech mlk in which he said he had been to the mountaintop and I marvel at his erudition and wisdom Here he was speaking to his tribe consisting of ordinary folks and he began by referring to a general and panoramic view of the whole of human history up to now And then went on to cite examples relevant to his tribe s current situation Unfortunately outstanding societal leaders such as King seem to have been produced more by accident than by intention and of course when such leaders have emerged they have all too often been gunned down victims of the very systems they are trying to change We need more actions and fewer words Our political leaders along with our commentariat too often seem to think it sufficient to spout reams of empty words with the sole intent of grabbing our attention for some little space of time Although I ve been a user of Apple products for many years it was only recently that I viewed my first Apple Event event and I was surprised by it in some odd way that I could not quite define for myself It s only now as I write this piece that I realize what aspect of this recorded presentation struck me with its novelty People were using words not to talk about what they wanted to do or what they thought should be done or what they would do if only they could they were using words to briefly explain what they had already accomplished And each thing described was plainly the result of long months and years of dedicated application of significant resources by themselves and their colleagues More doing Less talking That s what we need I made earlier reference to the growing urgency of environmental issues And this brings me to the next element of The Big Truth There are too many of us For far too long our leaders have been motivated by growth in all things Business leaders want to increase their sales Shareholders want to increase their profits Political leaders want to grow their GDP Religious leaders want to increase the sizes of their flocks And population growth is an easy fuel for growth in all these other areas But where does all this lead All the data pop indicates that human population levels have been growing at an incredible rate to unsustainable levels and is still arcing upwards And for many of us I know this has become a felt reality Traffic has gotten worse Housing prices have gone up Cities have become more crowded Job markets have become more competitive Infrastructure can t keep up And those who dream of moving from the city to the country find that the country has already filled up and houses are still unaffordable there if they haven t burnt to the ground in the latest round of devastating fires It was not so long ago in human history that population growth was something that could help a tribe survive could help a group defend itself from attacks by others But human population growth is a two edged sword and we are increasingly seeing the effects of turning the blade upon ourselves It s time to bring this reality out into the open and have some honest discussion about its implications And now on to the final element of The Big Truth We cannot all have infinite abundance This started as sort of a new age idea in the sixties And it has been fueled by advances in technology with its record of bringing so many of us wave after wave of increased productivity greater comfort and ever shinier new toys But as environmental concerns pile up technology can no longer keep up New technologies with other goals often have undesirable ecological side effects and technologies with explicit goals of reducing environmental stress are not coming along quickly enough And so now no matter where we live and no matter what our station in life we have to acknowledge the reality of limited resources Even in the richest country in the world as I so often hear the US described there are not enough riches for all of us to enjoy wealth not enough resources to accomplish every worthwhile goal This does not mean we cannot pursue and achieve goals of justice and equity but it does mean that our leaders have to help us make hard decisions about how to allocate finite sets of resources The Bottom Line And so in order to end the growth of The Big Lie I think it is past time to acknowledge and embrace all five elements of The Big Truth 1 Our leaders have repeatedly and thoroughly failed to take actions necessary for the survival of the tribes to which most of us belong 2 Our educational systems have failed to produce the leaders we need and instead have produced people who have led us down blind alleys and into box canyons 3 Human population growth cannot continue forever and current population levels have already reached a level that is unsustainable 4 We need more doing and less talking 5 We cannot pretend that we have access to infinite wealth hard decisions will have to be made about how to best allocate scarce resources Now here s the thing if we look at the success of Trump and the political Right over the last several years I think we can easily see that people have been driven in that direction because of the Left s refusal to acknowledge what I am calling The Big Truth After all the assertions that I have made above are not abstract and academic these are things that ordinary people see and feel on a daily basis even perhaps on a subconscious level And if one set of leaders acts as if none of these things are true if they in fact try to assert an alternate sort of reality then we should not be too surprised when other leaders emerge who are valued precisely because they say what they feel and what others are feeling and do not hide behind politically correct representations of reality As Shakespeare noted at the length truth will out and if one party is not willing to acknowledge it then others will So it s time for leaders who wish to be worthy of that title to acknowledge The Big Truth and start with these realities before trying to lead us to a better future Anything else I fear will doom us to yet another cycle of political opportunism that leads us nowhere abyss https www nytimes com 2021 01 09 magazine trump coup html coup https practopian org blog hbowie the clown coup html event https www apple com apple events october 2020 mlk https www

		content: "Let me take you on a little journey of thought exploring some hitherto unconsidered aspects of our common cultural evolution Developmental Levels as an Evolution in Consciousness I ve written before about cultural evolution cul that occurs through the achievement of successive developmental levels devlev These developmental stages can be viewed through an objective lens or through a subjective or an intersubjective lens That is we can look at each stage from an exterior perspective or from a singular interior perspective or from a collective interior perspective For more on these various perspectives see The Four Quadrants of Human Knowledge quads From a subjective or inter subjective perspective it is tempting to view these stages of development as having some ethical direction For example Ken Wilber has said wilber that > moral development tends to move from me egocentric to us ethnocentric to all of us worldcentric a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness In a similar vein and in a better known quotation Martin Luther King once said king > The arc of history is long but it bends towards justice Developmental Levels as Evolving Communications Strategies However it is also possible to look at these same stages of development from a more objective exterior viewpoint as a series of Evolving Social Structures socstr When taking this perspective it may be useful to remember this comment from Yuval Noah Harari harari > To the best of our knowledge only Sapiens can cooperate in very flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers This concrete capability rather than an eternal soul or some unique kind of consciousness explains our mastery of planet Earth And so from this perspective we can look at these developmental levels as a series of communication strategies enabling ever greater levels of human cooperation Family bonds including verbal sharing of knowledge and resources with kith and kin as well as passing these along from one generation to the next through oral traditions Hierarchies hier allowing large organizations to be built to handle complex missions Written wisdom written that can be shared uniformly across large groups and passed down to new generations without unintended variation Peer networks that allow informed interested and qualified participants to share and preserve the best existing knowledge and to test potential new discoveries Pluralistic societies that allow strangers from many different backgrounds to peacefully coexist in an egalitarian framework that allows and encourages the emergence of new and unplanned communications channels From this perspective it s good to note that these various communications strategies can all productively complement each other Even though later ones have developed gradually over time we shouldn t think of later ones as being superior to earlier ones or as rendering earlier ones obsolete rather each new one simply represents one more tool in the toolbox From this exterior perspective it s also important to realize that technology has played an essential role in these various stages of development As human communication has evolved from grunts to spoken language to mathematical expressions to the written word to the printing press the telegraph the telephone the fax machine and the Internet these technical advances have proven to be essential enablers for various stages of development As just one example it s hard to see how humans could have formed working productive peer networks enabling many scientific advances without the use of the printing press to publish books and journals Continuing Stages of Development With hindsight of course it s relatively easy to see how these various interrelated factors have played their respective roles in our human cultural evolution But how will our culture continue to evolve in the future How is it evolving now Answering those questions is a bit trickier Again from an interior perspective it s tempting to think of our future cultural evolution as a moral or spiritual journey to increasingly higher ground Wilber might characterize this as a journey from worldcentric to kosmocentric Clare Graves graves the originator of the developmental levels as defined in Spiral Dynamics spiral characterized this as a transition from subsistence levels to being levels Some might describe this as a transition from first tier to second tier The problem with this sort of thinking it seems to me is that these projections seem to be based on wishful thinking concerning the nature of human interior development but are unsupported by any evident corresponding changes in human social structures And while we might argue about whether interior development precedes exterior or vice versa probably with as much success as our usual chicken or the egg debates it seems clear that we can t have one entirely without the other If there is going to be development to a new level or stage then there will be interior aspects to that development but there will also be exterior aspects And if we can t describe any new enabling technologies and social structures then it would seem pointless to talk about ever more refined levels of human consciousness Having finally reached this point in our thinking it might be only natural to look about us to see if there are any communications strategies or social structures we might have overlooked or failed to sufficiently appreciate Broadcasting as a Communications Strategy And here I m afraid we don t have to look very far For there is one major communications strategy that has assumed preeminent importance over the last century that we haven t yet mentioned broadcasting For a description of what I mean here the introduction from Wikipedia broad will serve us well > Broadcasting is the distribution of audio or video content to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium in a one to many model Broadcasting began with AM radio which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers Before this all forms of electronic communication were one to one with the message intended for a single recipient This communications strategy has been so omnipresent for all of us alive today that we no doubt take it for granted And while we tend to think of broadcasting in terms of radio and television programming it is clear that these sorts of one to many communications are now showing up in telephone calls in text messages in emails in app notifications on our personal devices as well as in purportedly social media such as Facebook and Twitter Now this sort of broadcasting clearly has its uses as the occasional tests to our Emergency Broadcast System ebs remind us But it is also ripe for misuse Lessons from the Last Century Hollywood director Frank Capra clearly highlighted some of these issues in his 1941 film Meet John Doe mjd A newspaper reporter fabricates a piece of fake news about an unemployed John Doe threatening suicide on Christmas Eve in protest of society s ills The story goes viral and the newspaper interviews a series of homeless people looking for someone who can pretend to be the nameless protester described in the original article The person they pick has an older companion who rants about heelots a lot of heels who are constantly trying to get money from others The reporter pens a series of pieces supposedly written by John Doe complaining about society s ills which are read aloud by the John Doe character and broadcast over the radio Their simple theme be a better neighbor At this point both the John Doe character and the reporter begin to sincerely take the perspective of the fictional character and begin to see the good that is coming from their radio broadcasts with John Doe clubs forming all over the country to help their neighbors in need At this point a major industrialist with money and political ambitions decides to co opt this movement for his own purposes He helps to organize a national convention bringing together representatives from the now nationwide John Doe clubs The John Doe character is scheduled to deliver a speech written by the reporter But at the last minute the industrialist coerces the reporter into producing a speech that will announce the formation of a new political party with the industrialist being endorsed as the party s presidential candidate The John Doe character rebels and refuses to politicize the movement He tries to speak to the assembled crowd to tell them how he really feels but the industrialist gets to the microphone first and denounces the John Doe character as a fraud Doe tries to speak to the crowd but the industrialist cuts the wires effectively silencing Doe Capra famously had troubles figuring out how to provide an upbeat conclusion to this dark tale filming four different endings and testing them on various audiences in different theaters around Southern California In the end though he was unable to come up with any sort of fully triumphant resolution which may be one reason why this movie is not as well known today as some of his others such as Mr Smith Goes to Washington What s striking to me is the degree to which this story from eight decades ago sounds like something from today s headlines Update the technology a bit and it s all too familiar Of course it was only a couple of years before the making of Meet John Doe that Hitler had addressed 15 000 party faithful in Berlin hitler demanding that Czechoslovakia cede the Sudetenland or face invasion while having his words broadcast live to millions around the globe including simultaneous translations into many foreign languages And it was only a few weeks after Hitler s speech that CBS broadcast Orson Welles famous radio adaptation of War of the Worlds unintentionally causing widespread panic among US citizenry This whole concept of one source being able to simultaneously broadcast to millions of people was still a relatively new phenomenon back then and so perhaps it was easier for Capra to take a serious look at it back in the 1940 s than it is for us today when we just accept it as part of the fabric of our existence Benefits and Dangers of Broadcasting So what can we say about this communications strategy of broadcasting including its use and misuse in our society today Here are some thoughts 1 Broadcasting is a one way one to many communications strategy that transmits a message from a single source to a whole host of recipients 2 At its best broadcasting is an efficient means to transmit important breaking news to large masses of people across great distances And in a world of increasing global interdependence this ability is more important than ever 3 Broadcasting can also be used as a unifying force for large groups of people especially at a national level Whether it s watching a favorite television show or listening to a speech from a leader such broadcasts can bring people together in large numbers For Americans of my generation as an example it s hard to talk about the early popularity of The Beatles without collective reminiscence of the original Ed Sullivan broadcasts introducing the Fab Four to our North American shores And of course sports broadcasting has grown tremendously in the past several decades unifying fans from all over the world as they follow their favorite sports and teams 4 Broadcasting can all too easily be used to distort or misrepresent the truth as well as being used to transmit it in an unvarnished state By its very nature broadcasting is useful for communicating information that people cannot easily verify or contradict through first hand knowledge 5 The ability to unify people seems to work equally well whether they are being unified around an inspiring truth or a destructive falsehood As with the Orson Welles broadcast as well as with the rise of Hitler when everyone around you is hearing the same message at the same time from an authority in power then you ve created a powerful echo chamber that amplifies the message being transmitted 6 Since broadcasting requires lots of carefully coordinated expensive technological infrastructure it is inevitably a tool for those with money and power And so the mission basics the importance of mission html of those wielding this power becomes vitally important As one example the Public Broadcasting Service PBS in the US is a nonprofit with the mission to serve the American public with programming and services of the highest quality using media to educate inspire entertain and express a diversity of perspectives On the other hand a Google search for the mission of Fox News did not turn up any results 7 When broadcasting is employed by those with money and power and is used by a for profit enterprise and the only goal is to make more money and acquire more power well then we might occasionally be skeptical about the veracity and motivation of their transmissions And of course this isn t limited to Fox News and it s not meant to give PBS or other nonprofits a free pass 8 Advertising and broadcasting fit together as naturally as a hand and a glove When a business is trying to introduce a new product or service or change public perception of an existing one broadcasting is the fastest way to communicate the desired message straight from your marketing department to millions of consumers 9 And while we could easily devote an entire separate column to an analysis of advertising let us simply say for now that advertising s overall benefit to society seems entirely questionable In many ways advertising represents a consumer s deal with the devil Offer me a bunch of diverting programming for free and in return I ll allow you to interrupt the flow of programming periodically to show me advertisements that I would otherwise not choose to see And oh by the way you can show me the same ad repeatedly and it does not need to contain the slightest shred of truth And if you want to try to subliminally influence my buying decisions then hey go for it A Faustian bargain if ever there was one 10 Broadcasting is especially fraught with danger when funded by advertising and or by bundled content providers such as cable television since then the quantity of content is valued over its quality and the mission is reduced to simply keeping the bundle sold or acting as a carrier for whatever advertising pays the most 11 As a tool for getting real work done remembering Harari s quote above broadcasting is best used infrequently In my time working for a successful major American corporation over the course of decades broadcasting was used very little Even when there was some important new strategic direction to be communicated throughout the organization leaders recognized that flowing the message downward through the hierarchy with each leader successively talking to his or her direct reports was much more effective because it allowed appropriate adaptation of the message for each group and carried more credibility than an impersonal message broadcast from on high As another example see the video of the 1997 WWDC Fireside Chat with Steve Jobs jobswwdc Even though this was a critical moment in Apple s history and even though he needed to drastically change the company s direction he talked to developers face to face entertained questions from the audience and responded to tough questions with authenticity and aplomb 12 That being said it s probably obvious that broadcasting as a communications strategy is tremendously overused in today s society especially in advertising and politics I receive 50 to 60 emails everyday from various Democrats and progressives none of which come from anyone I ve personally met and almost all of which are purporting to deliver some breaking news about how the Republicans will end the world tomorrow if I don t give the senders my time and money immediately All of these messages go straight into a Politics folder and I delete them en masse once a day without looking at them Sorry guys and gals I m sympathetic but I don t need this volume of one to many communications on a daily basis demanding my money and attention As another example see this series of covers from the NRA s magazine nra American Rifleman From 1923 through the seventies these covers showed readers outdoorsy pictures of their fellow enthusiasts along with nature and wildlife Starting in the Reagan years though the covers all turned heavily political constantly seeking to divide and polarize Helpful Probably not 13 Even when used to deliver actual breaking news broadcasting may be overused to the detriment of society as a whole Analysts such as Steven Pinker in his book The Better Angels of our Nature have pointed out that modern citizens seem to form the belief that society today is more violent that it was in the past even though actual statistics show the opposite simply because our daily news media pick up and widely broadcast and focus on such tragedies so intensively And the increase of mass shootings in America can partially be traced to a media contagion effect shooters with most shooters wishing to emulate a previous mass shooter and with the promise of achieving national media attention proving to be powerful motivation for these dangerous individuals 14 And with all this being said it might be safe to theorize that broadcasting is most effective when you are trying to reach an audience that is not otherwise well connected via one of the other communications strategies listed above say people who are retired or otherwise unemployed or living in remote rural areas This might explain for example why Hitler was able to rise to power in the 1930 s when over 30 of the German workforce was unemployed A Broadcasting Consciousness So coming full circle in our inner to outer journey it might be reasonable to ask whether there is a corresponding subjective state that matches up with the broadcasting communications strategy In other words is there a broadcasting consciousness Unfortunately even though it s hard to peg this as an advance on any kind of upward moral trajectory that I can identify I m afraid there is I would describe it like this Reactive rather than reflective Addictive tending towards increasing levels of consumption A feeling of unification and bonding around a shared set of images and catchphrases A feeling of superiority over and opposition towards some other group s regularly vilified in the broadcasts An inability to seriously consider other points of view A paucity of original thought that is a lack of thoughts and ideas originating from within What We Can All Do What can we do to fight the spread of broadcast consciousness First of all become aware of broadcasting as a communications strategy and become aware of a broadcasting consciousness in yourself and those around you Share this awareness with others If you currently find yourself spending too much time tuning in to various broadcasts whether from your favorite television news channel or from non social alerts and notifications on your personal device s turn them off and look for other more effective communications strategies that you can enable in your life Regularly consider news sources that do original reporting and that offer differing perspectives Avoid news sources that simply parrot items of dubious parentage and collections of news sources that all seem to simply repeat a common message without any new analysis or investigation In this regard you might want to be aware of research reported here kleinc In particular look for ways to become more reflective and less reactive You might start by selecting and then reading a new book on some topic of interest being careful to pick something that won t simply tell you things you already think you know In management circles this is often described as paying more attention to what s important and less attention to what s

		title: "Building a Case for the Detective Story",
		date: "07 May 2019",
    url: "appreciation/building-a-case-for-the-detective-story.html",
		content: "Over the many years since the receipt of my Bachelor s degree in English from the University of Michigan I have probably spent more rewarding hours reading detective stories than any other form of fiction Such reliance on a particular genre is often viewed as a marked deficiency in taste and erudition so I d like to take a few minutes to defend my predilection Let me start with an observation from Raymond Chandler one of the recognized masters of the form Few Are Called to Greatness As Chandler noted in The Simple Art of Murder chandler1 > Nor is it any part of my thesis to maintain that it the detective story is a vital and significant form of art There are no vital and significant forms of art there is only art and precious little of that The growth of populations has in no way increased the amount it has merely increased the adeptness with which substitutes can be produced and packaged In other words most detective stories are rubbish and it is no part of my intent to defend them today Now that we ve got that out of the way let me describe for you the ten elements that I look for in a good mystery 1 Moral Distinctions One of the things I appreciate about the form is that a good mystery has things to say about the differences between right and wrong between good and evil In older more traditional mysteries these moral distinctions often come easily it is the murderer who is wrong and everyone else who is right In more modern stories however especially those following WW I these distinctions are often more shaded Many characters have mixed motives and we can even discern varied standards of ethics among the casts of petty crooks and grifters that populate the American noir stories of Chandler and Dashiell Hammett Mystery authors by this point are depicting many of their characters as victims of an uncaring and unequal society rather than simply focusing on the errant behavior of a single criminal and the unusual deaths of a few individuals Unlike much modern fiction however which simply tells us that everyone has secrets and we are all flawed and guilty and all morality is relative the mystery form requires the resolution of the ethical dilemmas being exposed We are required along with the detective and his or her companions and assistants to make hard choices People will go free or be found guilty In other words a good detective story requires us to exercise our ethical muscles And this is something we can all use in these troubled and troubling times 2 A True Hero All fictional detectives have flaws of one sort or another None of them are perfect And yet a good mystery is required to present us with a genuine hero someone who is a positive role model of sorts Our hero will confront challenges and rise above them And the way he or she does this the qualities they display the means they use will tell us what the author thinks is important about how we live our own lives in the world we find around us To cite Chandler again chandler2 > Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean who is neither tarnished nor afraid If there were enough like him I think the world would be a very safe place to live in and yet not too dull to be worth living in Here Chandler makes explicit the attributes of the hero he depicts in his novel But now let s look at the opening paragraphs of The Big Sleep to see how these traits are portrayed in a work of fiction > It was about eleven o clock in the morning mid October with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills I was wearing my powder blue suit with dark blue shirt tie and display handkerchief black brogues black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them I was neat clean shaved and sober and I didn t care who knew it I was everything the well dressed private detective ought to be I was calling on four million dollars > > The main hallway of the Sternwood place was two stories high Over the entrance doors which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants there was a broad stained glass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didn t have any clothes on but some very long and convenient hair The knight had pushed the vizor of his helmet back to be sociable and he was fiddling with the knots on the ropes that tied the lady to the tree and not getting anywhere I stood there and thought that if I lived in the house I would sooner or later have to climb up there and help him He didn t seem to really be trying So here we are introduced to a detective who sits at the juncture of different worlds rich and poor cultured and crude romantic and realistic and whose view of all these things is observant independent and imaginative He has a sense of humor about himself and about those around him We are invited to consider him in heroic terms through the comparison to a knight of old but at the same time Chandler makes clear that he is a modern hero updated for the time and place in which he lives If this all sounds of interest the opening seems to say then come on in and find out more A better introduction to a fascinating detective is hard to imagine Different authors will have different sorts of heroes and this is part of the fun Some you will like more than others but all of them should have something to teach us If they don t then they probably need to be thrown back onto the great rubbish heap 3 Lives Worth Living Almost all mysteries feature murder as their primary criminal act and with good reason the taking of an innocent human life is the ultimate evil the standard by which all others are judged And so all detective stories will draw a picture of evil for us The best ones though also give us a means to measure the depth of the loss that happens when a life is taken by contrasting the ravages of death with the joys of human life well lived And it is this juxtaposition the depiction of the joys of life alongside the evil of murder that makes us as readers care deeply about what happens over the course of the story and makes us feel keenly whatever losses may befall or threaten our characters Again different authors will have different ideas of what that good life looks like and experiencing and unwrapping all of this is part of the pleasure that comes with reading a good detective story For Louise Penny the good life can be found in the quiet rural Canadian community of Three Pines Chandler on the other hand had somewhat different views > The other part of me wanted to get out and stay out But this was the part I never listened to Because if I ever had I would have stayed in the town where I was born and worked in the hardware store and married the boss s daughter and had five kids and read them the funny paper on Sunday morning and smacked their heads when they got out of line and squabbled with the wife about how much spending money they were to get and what programs they could have on the radio or TV set I might even have got rich small town rich an eight room house two cars in the garage chicken every Sunday and the Reader s Digest on the living room table the wife with a cast iron permanent and me with a brain like a sack of Portland cement You take it friend I ll take the big sordid dirty crooked city Of course the small village of Three Pines is home to a gay couple running the local bistro a retired black psychologist running the bookstore a famous Canadian poet who goes nowhere without her duck and a pair of painters both of whom are nationally recognized at different points in Penny s cycle of stories so Marlowe might have actually enjoyed spending some time there if he had ever felt like taking a vacation from his native Los Angeles What s your ideal vision of the good life After reading a great detective story it should hopefully have been altered and enhanced 4 A Sense of Human Agency In many stories the characters are overtaken by events Or their fate is determined by their character flaws And this is certainly true in most detective stories as well the victim is typically overtaken by events and the criminal typically laid low in the end by character flaws But then as E M Forster noted forster > Failure or success seem to have been allotted to men by their stars But they retain the power of wriggling of fighting with their star or against it and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle The detective story focuses our attention on this wriggling The detective is quintessentially a wriggler someone who is not content to simply accept the events that happen to them and others around them but someone who fights against them who takes action to change the course of the story to uncover the criminal to prevent further criminal acts And in this world of ours today we need a hell of a lot more wriggling 5 Distinguishing between Appearance and Reality If all of reality were available to us through surface appearances then there would be no role for detectives and there would be no mysteries to unravel But the premise of every detective story is that the way things appear is quite different from the way things actually are and as the story unfolds one illusion after another typically falls away revealing the underlying reality Stories of detection also typically reveal the actions of characters under pressure often both perpetrators and the detectives themselves with the strong presumption that what people do under pressure reveals some truer character than that revealed in more ordinary circumstances 6 A Beacon of Rationality Many detective stories especially the earlier ones are a great deal about the triumph of reason over superstition Consider for example Arthur Conan Doyle s Sherlock Holmes story The Hound of the Baskervilles or many of the novels by John Dickson Carr Almost all mysteries though teach us the important elements of critical thinking crit careful observation a disinclination to accept apparently easy and obvious truths at face value reasoned analysis the value of independent thought the superiority of proof over mere suspicion In this way a good detective story will demonstrate for us the advantages of achieving the modern level of development devlev including application of the scientific method 7 Narrative Abundance Almost every good mystery will have to tell us not just one but several good stories a The story of the murder which is gradually discovered over the course of the novel and finally revealed at the work s end b The story of discovery showing us how the crime often in the form of a lifeless body was originally found c The story of detection involving the work of one or more investigators professional or amateur in uncovering the nature of the crime d The story interrupted that is the story of the murder victim s Such a story adds meaning to the loss of the victim e The story threatened The occurrence of one murder often creates an explicit or implicit threat to others in a shared community and their stories again add meaning to the work of the detective in defending that community f The ornamental story various other tales embedded in the narration in order to help conceal the story of the murder The weaving together of all these tales into a cohesive whole is not easy but proves rewarding and entertaining when done well 8 A Great Deal of Fun A mystery author is much like a magician in order to work her magic in plain sight of her audience she has to devise a whole series of entertaining distractions The best mystery authors beguile us with unique characters and actions that prove entertaining on their own Take for example Edmund Crispin s English professor turned detective Gervase Fen paired with the character of Sir Richard Freeman Chief Constable of Oxford who wants nothing more than to discuss English literature whenever he meets Fen over the course of an investigation Or consider the genuinely spooky atmosphere often created by John Dickson Carr when setting the stage for his carefully calculated acts of mayhem Within the context of a mystery such elements serve the dual ends of distracting us from prematurely fitting together the key pieces of the puzzle while providing us with extravagant entertainment along the way As Chandler noted we want a world that is a safe place to live in and yet not too dull to be worth living in In a good mystery life is never dull 9 A Sense of Humor Occasional humor provides a nice contrast with the inevitably dark presentation of evil deeds and helps to round out the author s notion of a life well lived An entirely humorless novel about murder would be a grim affair indeed 10 Great Writing We all have different standards by which we judge such a thing but my favorite mysteries all share a careful attention to language used in novel ways to make us see our normal surroundings in a new and different light Take as an example just the first sentence of Chandler s The Big Sleep already quoted above > It was about eleven o clock in the morning mid October with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills The bare facts contained in this sentence could have easily been communicated in a far more conventional manner But look at the pains Chandler takes to draw us away from mere facts and instead convey mood and character and a sense of place Note that he doesn t give us an exact time or date Instead it s about eleven o clock in the morning mid October He doesn t tell us it is cloudy but instead says with the sun not shining And then he finishes with this marvelous image of a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills Somehow while describing the detective s physical environment Chandler has also managed to paint a picture for us I could take another couple of hundred words to try to unpack what he s doing here but that would probably just ruin the effect Suffice it to say that this is something different than what you ll hear in the morning weather report no matter what station you re listening to Different authors have different styles but for me it is important to have some sense of style and a sure command of the language used to convey something more than a rote description of everyday events 11 A Playful Sense of Adventure Finally a good mystery offers the thrill of the chase the adventure of encountering the new and the unknown a rapid succession of momentous events and the threat of danger As readers we are often aware of a strong sense of play exhibited by the author in the contrivance of these portions of the narrative and yet we are still swept up in the action happily granting the author a willing suspension of disbelief These oft quoted paragraphs from Arthur Conan Doyle give a good sense of what I mean here > Come Watson come he cried The game is afoot Not a word Into your clothes and come > > Ten minutes later we were both in a cab and rattling through the silent streets on our way to Charing Cross Station A Few Examples Here are some of my preferred mystery authors listed alphabetically along with one or two of my favorite works by each I believe each of them lives up to the standards I ve set above Margery Allingham allingham Recently named by no less a personage than J K Rowling rowling as her favorite mystery author Allingham penned a series of eighteen novels featuring gentleman sleuth Albert Campion Many of her books are quite different from one another and Campion matures and even marries over the course of her works so it s hard to pick out an obvious favorite But Mystery Mile is a good place to start John Dickson Carr carr is often referred to as the acknowledged master of the locked room mystery in which the victim dies alone inside of a sealed room making the mysteries of means and opportunity paramount Carr s best detective was Gideon Fell whose form and character were allegedly based on those of G K Chesterton There are many novels to choose from but The Man Who Could Not Shudder might be a good starting point Raymond Chandler chandler The Big Sleep is hard to beat but Chandler s last and longest Marlowe novel The Long Goodbye is also one of my favorites Edmund Crispin crispin Gervase Fen is an Oxford Professor of English Language and Literature as well as an amateur sleuth Crispin s books are witty literate and at times farcical The Moving Toyshop is everyone s favorite among the Fen canon and you certainly can t go wrong with that but Love Lies Bleeding is probably the one I ve enjoyed the most Arthur Conan Doyle doyle His detective Sherlock Holmes is the world s best known fictional detective and for obvious reasons Hard to go wrong with The Hound of the Baskervilles Dashiell Hammett hammett Unlike most other authors on this list Hammett did not stick to a single fictional detective for all of his books making them a bit more varied The Maltese Falcon with Sam Spade is the obvious classic but The Thin Man featuring Nick and Nora Charles is its own world of fun And The Dain Curse is also hard to beat Michael Innes innes Probably his best known work is The Journeying Boy which is a superb adventure story but most of his detective stories featured John Appleby who progresses over the course of the books from a lowly inspector to Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and finally into active retirement It is a long series and Innes varies the locales and stories quite a bit so it s hard to find an obvious place to start Hamlet Revenge the second book in the series is probably as good a recommendation as any Robert Parker parker His detective Spenser is featured in 40 novels I once heard Parker speak He had no advice for struggling writers because he said that he had simply started writing Spenser novels one day and began selling them immediately and then never looked back He also had no advice in terms of outlining or preparation because he said he simply sat down and wrote them out He died in 2010 at the age of 77 while sitting at his desk and working on his next book The Spenser novels are set in and around Boston and are full of interesting details about that city and the surrounding area A notable feature of the series is Spenser s long running romantic relationship with psychologist Susan Silverman Parker uses the character and her relationship with Spenser to give his detective a bit of class but also to provide interesting contrast between their two personalities and to explore the ability of a person to be true to themselves without compromise and yet to also give themselves to another as part of a lasting and loving relationship Most of the books are very similar to each other and I don t recall running across a bad one I would recommend starting with one from the 80 s perhaps Pale Kings and Princesses One could certainly accuse some of the later ones of being a bit rote but I must confess I enjoyed all of them Louise Penny penny Penny is a Canadian author and her detective is Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec She only began her literary career in 2005 and has turned out fifteen Gamache novels since then Her books have won a slew of awards and she is still writing Her books center around the mythical town of Three Pines somewhere outside of Québec a place that cannot be found on any maps Penny s detective Gamache is a true original depicted often as a leader rather than the usual solitary investigator or the brilliant detective accompanied by an often buffoonish foil The series is notable because of the large cast of recurring characters some of whom become active components of investigations in various books The idyllic rural life of Three Pines is described in loving and varied detail and this is a strong element in her work Her books also have a strong moral element and evil surfaces in many forms Still Life starts the series and won many awards so is as good a place to start as any Summary I can t recommend a steady diet of detective fiction There are many different types of stories that need to be told and heard and they can t all fit neatly into this particular set of literary conventions But the best detective stories offer great rewards to readers and they certainly deserve a place of honor on your bookshelves and reading lists I hope that some of the ones I ve recommended today will bring you as much joy and enlightenment as they ve delivered for me allingham https en wikipedia org wiki Margery Allingham carr https en

    url: "blog/hbowie/calling-for-a-us-sustainability-initiative.html",
		content: "Looking back over the history of the United States it s easy to see in hindsight a series of events and actions that have either united or divided us The Revolutionary War the ratification of our US Constitution World War II and the race to put a man on the moon can all be seen as efforts that ultimately brought us together as a nation On the other hand our Civil War and the Vietnam conflict are examples of actions that tragically divided us Of course hindsight tends to emphasize outcomes and retrospective feelings and understate periods of contention leading up to decisive action Looking back from today s perspective for example we see WW II as a great triumph for America Initially though our country was very reluctant to enter another European conflict and it took the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and persuasion from leaders in the form of media such as the Why We Fight wwf series of films to rally our nation around the cause of stopping fascism Looking at our great nation today of course it is all too easy to see the divisions that run through our society I don t think I need to elaborate on them here Instead I want to ask the question is there a great common cause that can help bring us together today And I ask this knowing in advance that no possible initiative will begin its life with universal acceptance but that instead any such proposal will start out encountering a great deal of opposition When I look at possible candidates for some sort of great national enterprise that might bring us together in this way I can think of only one that is likely to succeed a National Sustainability Initiative Consider 1 Sustainability sustain is the greatest human challenge of our era There are lots of facts and arguments to support this position and many experts to endorse it 2 As we Americans witness continually growing housing costs overcrowded cities and roadways crumbling infrastructure climbing temperatures increasingly destructive wildfires rising sea levels the negative impacts of fracking the extinction of species growing economic inequality and increasing levels of pollution the issue of sustainability becomes an everyday concern for most of us rather than an academic debate 3 The primary goals of the initiative could be strongly centered on national interests with positive impacts that would be felt by most US citizens 4 There could be many different threads to this initiative with the opportunity to involve almost everyone in our society in one capacity or another 5 Part of the initiative could be to maintain a sustainable US population size thus providing a meaningful context for immigration policy 6 Once we can achieve some agreement on a sustainable population size as a meaningful goal we can regain broader support for family planning and birth control which should help to bring down abortion rates as well as rates of unwanted pregnancies 7 Investments in research development and industrial capacity could help to foster a renewed sense of US leadership in science and technology and manufacturing 8 Such an initiative would have a forward looking focus with the goal of building a better world for our children and generations to come 9 Badly needed infrastructure development could be energized by a sustainability emphasis providing the sense that we are not just fixing up the old stuff that is crumbling but helping to build something new and better that will last longer 10 Implementing something like a national Environmental Impact Tax could help to reduce environmental degradation while at the same time providing a meaningful rationale for taxation 11 Sustainability work could help provide more and better jobs for Americans 12 Even with a primary focus on helping Americans such an initiative would allow our country to regain a moral high ground and a renewed opportunity to exercise world leadership Gaining support for such an initiative would not be easy and would need to be worked by a broad coalition including government non profits and for profit companies So much of our attention these days seems to be mired in issues that we have been arguing about for decades budget deficits global trade racial and gender discrimination labor rights environmental protection gun violence national parks and reserves social security military readiness immigration abortion that we often seem overcome by the same sense of ennui and déjà vu that surely must be felt by hamsters going around on the wheels in their cages we re getting lots of exercise but we don t seem to be making much progress It is not that these issues aren t important or that they don t deserve our attention on the other hand if we re to make progress and not just choose up sides and battle each other endlessly it helps at times to adopt a new perspective to place these old problems in a fresh context By now if we re not busy sticking our heads in the sand I believe many of us realize that sustainability is the pressing context that we must focus on in order to ensure a livable future in this country and on this planet for ourselves and our children Perhaps this is why Rep elect Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N Y is already proposing work on a Green New Deal gnd I m not sure I like the branding she s using green seems to be a divisive term associated with radicals and extremism and new deal has connotations of social welfare I d rather see something suggestive of a technical project with a definite goal at the end of it something more akin to the space race Or to put it in terms of developmental levels levels I d like to see something framed to appeal more to red and orange levels tribal mythic and modern rational rather than strictly to the green level postmodern pluralistic But in any case I think this is a much needed step in the right direction A sustainable future won t happen by accident It s going to take all of us to make it a reality gnd https ocasio cortez house

		title: "Can the US Become a Truly Egalitarian Society",
		date: "15 Jun 2020",
    url: "blog/hbowie/can-the-us-become-a-truly-egalitarian-society.html",
		content: "As with many of us I ve been thinking deeply lately about the murders of George Floyd Ahmaud Arbery Breanna Taylor and so many other people of color and wondering how and why these atrocities continue to occur in my country and what we can do to turn things around Naming the Societal Models I ve concluded that there are basically two types of human societies with very different ways of thinking about themselves Let s call the first type of society the egalitarian model In this model as with all human societies there are various schemes for specialization and the productive division of labor but all of the different roles that people play are perceived to have roughly equal value Everyone contributes to society and everyone is valued Sure some people may make a little more than others but all members of society have enough income to live happy fulfilling lives Let s call the second type of society the hierarchical model In this model people are placed on a value hierarchy based on their roles in society with some at the top being regarded as highly valuable while those below are accorded decreasing assessments of value until those towards the bottom are considered to have little or no value to society In other words we can have one type of society in which every human being is viewed as worthy and valuable or we can have a very different sort of society in which most people are viewed as nearly worthless with a few towards the top of the heap considered to have supreme value In terms of politics and economics it s easy to associate the hierarchical model with the old schemes of royalty and to equate the egalitarian model with the democracies that followed In other words Let them eat cake https en wikipedia org wiki Let them eat cake vs Liberté égalité fraternité https en wikipedia org wiki Liberté égalité fraternité If only it were that simple Exterior and Interior Aspects of the Models Let us first consider the exterior aspects of the two models The egalitarian model depends on perhaps three different factors There must be sufficient wealth to support middle class lifestyles for the large majority of its members There must be sufficient work to keep the large majority of its members employed There must be sufficient industrialization and mechanization to avoid the need for brutal manual labor for the large majority of its members If any of these three factors are missing then it will be hard to sustain an egalitarian society no matter how noble our intentions and social structures are liable to revert to the hierarchical model Now let s look at the interior aspects of the two models How do people within these two types of societies think and feel If we re looking for an example of the egalitarian spirit then it s hard to do better than the story of Louis Armstrong s home in New York City https www nytimes com 2020 02 20 t magazine louis armstrong home queens html The king of jazz and his fourth and final wife decided to live in a humble neighborhood in Queens and Armstrong liked to refer to himself as a salary man who preferred to live on the same block as telephone operators schoolteachers and janitors In fact when Mrs Armstrong decided to give their house a brick façade Louis went door to door down the block offering to pay for similar upgrades for any of his neighbors who wanted one On the other hand if we re looking for an example of the hierarchical spirit we need look no farther than Mar a Lago and the various Trump hotels with their gold plated bathroom fixtures If we probe a bit deeper into these two mindsets then we find that believers in an egalitarian society genuinely feel that others in their society no matter the details of their origins or their stations in life share an equal worth with their own Everyone is valued No one is looked down upon We re all different but no one is superior or inferior because of our differences Diversity is naturally valued because of the understanding that society wouldn t work without everyone doing what they do best And it s assumed that everyone wants to contribute to society by finding what they re good at and then working at their chosen roles We need everyone and we re all in this together But then if we peer into the mind of a believer in hierarchy we find a very different perspective They believe that a great number of people are naturally lazy and shiftless For those towards the top of the value pyramid they believe that it is only natural for the cream to rise to the top At the same time they believe that those towards the bottom of the hierarchy must be kept hungry and frightened in order to get them to do any useful work at all The hierarchical viewpoint is that different sorts of people fit naturally into different positions in the hierarchy and that in order to maintain social order they must be kept in their respective positions Note that I m intentionally avoiding use of the terms socialism and capitalism here because I think it s dangerously miseleading to equate egalitarian thinking with socialism and to equate hierarchical thinking with capitalism Louis Armstrong was not associated with Karl Marx https en wikipedia org wiki Karl Marx And Donald Trump has never read a word of Adam Smith https en wikipedia org wiki Adam Smith One can be an egalitarian and yet still believe in a free market economy Unfortunately many fat cat capitalists and swollen headed students of Ayn Rand have given capitalism a bad name But for our purposes today let s set these two inflammatory terms aside and continue our discussion without them And so we can see that for each of these two societal models there are certain accompanying exterior factors things we can readily observe and measure as well as certain accompanying interior factors ways in which people think and feel Application to the United States When we look at some of the founding documents for our country we find nothing but the most egalitarian sentiments being expressed Here for example are some of the opening words of the Declaration of Independence https www archives gov founding docs declaration transcript published in 1776 > We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed Now of course the obvious explicit problem with these words viewed in hindsight is that these egalitarian sentiments were reserved for men no mention of women Additionally the less obvious implicit problem with these words is that the qualifier of European was assumed when these words were written native Americans and African Americans were assumed to be racially inferior and not deserving of inclusion in these otherwise noble sentiments And so the hierarchical seeds were planted in our egalitarian new world from the very beginning Native Americans were valued only for the lands that they occupied and African Americans were valued only for the back breaking labor they could furnish And so the apparent success of our American society was built on top of these two supporting pillars supplying the pretense of egalitarianism without the whole substance Much of the rest of our American history up to and including the present day can be seen as the often unsuccessful attempts to reconcile these two contradictory impulses And the might of armed police in the US has often been used not to keep the peace but to keep people of color and the lowest paid workers in their assigned slots in the hierarchy http criticalresistance org wp content uploads 2016 07 policing timelinenew pdf Even in an egalitarian society peacekeepers may be needed from time to time But only in a strongly hierarchical society are so many police https www seattletimes com seattle news after pouring money into police budget seattle faces a new reckoning with so many weapons https www charleskochinstitute org issue areas criminal justice policing reform militarization of police needed so often https en wikipedia org wiki List of killings by law enforcement officers by country to kill and imprison so many people https en wikipedia org wiki List of countries by incarceration rate Application to our Current Situation In some ways the old systems of hereditary nobility were much kinder and much less insidious than our current reality With the old systems at least everyone knew where they stood and the hierarchies were out in the open for everyone to see Our problems today I m convinced are made worse by the fact that those believing in hierarchy do not speak of it openly and so those believing in egalitarianism cannot confront it head on Instead we use an elaborate system of coded phrasing to avoid saying what we really mean Take our current situation here in Seattle as an example To be clear I live in Seattle in the city If I were to livestream the events outside my house you would see kids and parents and neighbors with everyone practicing respectful social distancing and people wearing masks as needed If you were to see the view from my window as I drive around my neighborhood you would see small and occasional groups of demonstrators standing on the sidewalk and carrying Black Lives Matter signs and smiling whenever a passing driver honks in support And yet my wife and I have had a few people call in the last few days to make sure we re ok Because they keep hearing reports on Fox News no doubt https www seattletimes com seattle news politics fox news runs digitally altered images in coverage of seattles protests capitol hill autonomous zone that our city is being demolished by rioters anarchists terrorists and members of the shadowy Antifa organization Nothing could be further from the truth What is true is that large numbers of people have been peacefully protesting in downtown Seattle for over a week And in one part of town where a heavily militarized police presence was standing in continual confrontation with protestors the police have temporarily withdrawn in order to distance the powder keg from the matches so to speak And what happened without the police No looting no destruction Instead we had peaceful protestors forming what they call the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone https www vanityfair com style 2020 06 nikkita oliver on seattles extraordinary protests CHAZ You could very accurately call this group egalitarian But to use the sort of labeling coming from our president and the right wing news media you would have to be a closet believer in hierarchy and so would have a strong need for the police to exert their military might in order to force people back into what you perceive to be their rightful places in the social order Why All of This Matters to Black Lives When I see a police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man and with conscious cruelty killing him in front of a crowd of black people all while being recorded on video I quite clearly see the intended message you people are of little value to our society and you need to be reminded of that fact When I see a group of white men hunting down and killing a black man out for a jog as if he were some sort of animal I see a similar message When I see our president casually having a crowd of peaceful protestors dispersed by spraying them with pepper spray I quite clearly see the intended message black people and those who demonstrate for racial justice are of little value to our society while I as president and successful capitalist am of immense value The problem here is that until we have a truly egalitarian society we will always have an underclass and it will always be made up of people of color and force will always be used to keep the underclass in its place And It s Not Just Republicans Our current Republican politicians and many of their supporters are clearly believers in a hierarchical society But they re not the only ones When you hear a Democratic candidate for president speak of a large segment of our society as a basket of deplorables https en wikipedia org wiki Basket of deplorables that s a pretty clear signal that they believe we live in a hierarchical society and a pretty clear indication of who they believe belongs at the bottom of that hierarchy And when you see a group of our political leaders supporting globalization https www thechicagocouncil org blog global insight globalization Democrat Republican parties and standing by while good paying jobs are shipped overseas with no apparent concern for what will become of the Americans who were previously earning decent middle class wages working at those jobs that s a pretty clear indication that they believe we live in a hierarchical society and a pretty clear indication of who they believe to be of little value The Bottom Line But again that s the problem with a modern social hierarchy which is never openly discussed the people towards the top can live in blissful ignorance of what s really going on while those lower down continue their daily struggle to avoid being forced to the very bottom And this is why many Americans today have grown tired of so called progressive leaders who are not truly working for an egalitarian society And so a large number would rather have someone who openly calls for true equality health care for all decent wages for all decent educations for all food for all shelter for all or someone who is willing to openly admit that we have a hierarchy and then is willing to clearly signal who belongs at the bottom Pretty much anyone who s been paying any attention at all understands at some level that the sort of hybrid mix of societal types that we ve been playing at is no longer viable And so it s time for our country to choose do we want a fascist hierarchy or do we want equal opportunity for all There s really no middle ground capitalism https practopian org blog hbowie the truth

		date: "25 Apr 2019",
    url: "blog/hbowie/the-challenge-for-democrats-playing-the-long-game.html",
		content: "Right now Democrats are focused primarily on two things happening in 2020 1 Beating Trump 2 Regaining control of the Senate These would both be great accomplishments for the party and for the winning candidates For the country not so much Why To answer that question we need only look at the history of divided government in the US div If we scan backwards for periods in which Democrats held the presidency and the majorities in both houses of congress here s what we find going all the way back for nearly seventy years to 1953 2 years from 2009 2011 2 years from 1993 1995 4 years from 1977 1981 8 years from 1961 1969 Now Republicans have no better record in this regard so you might wonder why I think this is such a big deal Two reasons 1 The Democratic agenda is forward looking and inclusive and progressive and it takes time persistence focus and unity to make headway on this sort of agenda 2 The Republican agenda is backwards looking divisive and destructive and all it takes to advance this agenda is money media confusion and a ruthless bent on defending the interests of those on the top of the heap while demolishing or disabling every governmental protection for those on the bottom Are you starting to get the picture When control of our federal government seesaws back and forth every couple of years with large periods of time in which control of the government is divided that doesn t mean the two parties are doing equally well It means the Republicans are winning First because given equal periods of time in control the Republicans are able to tear down a lot more than the Democrats are able to build back up in their comparable periods of dominance Second because this sort of perpetual deadlock combined with continuing back and forth changes in leadership have the overall effect of creating the appearance and in some cases the reality of a weak and ineffective federal government which plays right into the hands of Republicans So winning in 2020 would be a good start But it s not nearly enough Consider all of the issues that are important to Democrats right now civil rights healthcare rights for workers rebuilding our middle class strong support for a free press education environmental protections inequality LGBTQ rights systemic racial bias prison reform climate change tax reform just to name the headliners that occur to me off the top of my head Now how much real and lasting progress do you think we can make on any one of these vitally important issues let alone all of them if Democrats only end up in control for two years as happened in 2008 when Barack Obama became our president No the Democrats need to be strategizing and planning right now for a 20 year reign over our federal government Not because Democrats have all the answers or because we are morally pure or because we don t believe in a two party system I think a two party system is vitally important in order to keep any one party from becoming complacent and greedy and bureaucratic No the Democrats need to control our federal government for a couple of decades because our current Republican party has become morally and intellectually bankrupt We need to thoroughly expose them for what they have become grind them down into political irrelevance and then give our second party time to transform themselves into something that will be meaningful for the 21st century I don t think anyone knows what that will look like at this point But it s going to take a while So how can the Democrats acquire and retain enough control of our government to actually advance the important causes I listed above Here are a few suggestions Always be thinking at least one election cycle ahead Like a good pool player it s not enough to sink the ball you re aiming for you also need to position the cue ball so that you can drop the next one as well Aim for Democratic majorities in 38 of our 50 states Whether we like it or not and whether we think it fair or not both the Senate and the electoral college confer structural advantages on the Republicans Montana Delaware South Dakota Alaska North Dakota Vermont and Wyoming each have under a million residents but the votes of their senators count just as much as those from California which represents over 37 million Whining about this won t change anything Approval of constitutional amendments requires approval from 38 of our states and there are cases where such amendments might be needed especially in light of a Supreme Court now likely to be stacked in favor of Republicans for years if not decades to come Discredit Republican leaders and candidates but not those who voted for them You can t achieve the sort of political unity we need if you start out by demonizing everyone who has voted Republican during their lifetimes If you don t believe this just think back to Clinton s basket of deplorables basket remark in 2016 and reflect on how well that turned out The approach we need to take with all honesty and forthrightness is to identify the very real and important issues that have motivated people to vote Republican in recent elections and then communicate clearly and consistently that we understand those issues and are willing and able to address them This means we can t go for urban voters to the exclusion of rural and suburban ones We have to reach out to both This means we can t appeal to college graduates while ignoring those with fewer academic credentials We have to appeal to both This means we can t tailor our approach to favor people and communities of color while passing over people and communities of paler shades If we can t muster the will and resources to be this inclusive and unifying then we should just go home now and hand the reins over to someone who can Focus on the obvious Voters have the right to expect their government to have their best interests at heart But the modern Republican party under Donald Trump has become nothing more than a group of shameless con artists willing to do anything to cross any line in order to retain and consolidate their power solely for the purpose of funneling ever greater shares of American wealth to the richest 1 Just look at the tax bill that they passed tax their single significant legislative accomplishment during the Trump era So just persuade voters that we re better than that We don t have to be perfect We don t have to be all knowing We just have to get higher than this incredibly low bar set by our opponents We must have the best interests of American citizens at heart and we must be willing to roll up our sleeves and work tirelessly on their behalf If we can convince voters all across our country on these points then we should be able to achieve our goals Avoid overreach Overreach plays into the hands of Republicans and is part of this vicious cycle of never ending whipsaw changes in leadership This doesn t mean we have to be centrists What it means is that we have to avoid getting ahead of ourselves We have to keep things in the right order 1 Pick forward looking candidates capable of appealing to a broad swath of voters in the current election cycle 2 Unify our resources to actively and unreservedly support the selected candidates 3 Run winning campaigns 4 Undo Republican gerrymandering and voter suppression 5 Reduce the power of lobbyists large corporations and large donors to influence future elections 6 Educate voters on the issues Arm them with facts 7 Invest in development of the next generation of legislators executives and judges 8 Pass legislation that will have unequivocally positive benefits on at least 2 3 of voters before the next election cycle 9 Advance longer term interests such as reductions in carbon emissions while avoiding immediate and perceptible harm to the majority of voters in at least 3 4 of our states 10 Pay attention to things small as well as large The federal government is the nation s largest employer As always there s a lot of devil in the details and if you can t get the small things right it will trip you up when you try to slay the dragons 11 Work incrementally Take agile precepts agile to heart Everywhere you see the word customer think voter When you see the word software think legislation and government services When you run across the word developer replace it with legislators and political leaders 12 Listen to our critics and take them seriously Practice inclusion We re not perfect We can always do better Admit our mistakes Avoid NIH Not Invented Here nih syndrome 13 Rinse and repeat So let s not just focus on the 2020 elections for the next eighteen months Sure they re important victory is not assured and we need to do what it takes to put those behind us But at the same time let s think strategically and be smart about our future We re in this for the long haul Let s start playing the long game agile https agilemanifesto org principles html basket https en wikipedia org wiki Basket of deplorables div

    url: "blog/hbowie/citizen-kane-vs-citizen-bailey.html",
		content: "I ve often considered Citizen Kane kane and It s A Wonderful Life life to be complementary works much like cinematic twins separated at birth Consider first their similarities Kane was released in 1941 while Wonderful Life was released in 46 Both were highly collaborative productions and both were ultimately considered the signature works of their respective directors Orson Welles and Frank Capra Both films were box office failures when initially released but found appreciative audiences later in their long careers And both are often considered among the finest movies ever made best More significantly each film took on the challenge of summarizing a character s entire life during the course of roughly two hours Both told their stories via flashbacks and both used the dramatic device of having one or more narrators explaining elements of the character s life to an inquisitive outsider a reporter in Kane and an angel in Life And both began their stories with children playing in the snow There the similarities end though and in many other respects the films seem like mirror images of one another Kane is a tragedy ending with the main character s isolation and death Wonderful Life is a comedy although at times a dark one ending with our hero s redemption and growth Further differences are revealed when we view both films through the lens of developmental levels devlev as originally defined by Clare Graves Donald Beck and Christopher Cowan through their Spiral Dynamics spiral work and then later adapted by Ken Wilber through his Integral work In brief these theories posit that both individual humans as well as human cultures evolve upwards through a series of levels alternating between a focus on the individual and a focus on community Higher levels don t supersede lower levels but simply expand our range of human possibilities devlev2 for dealing with the problems of increasingly large complex and interdependent societies The following table offers a brief spiraling summary of the first six developmental levels often collectively referred to as first tier <table> <caption> The First Tier Developmental Spiral < caption> <thead> <tr> <th>Individualistic< th> <th>Community Focused< th> < tr> < thead> <colgroup> <col span= 1 class= column 50 > <col span= 1 class= column 50 > < colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan= 3 >

of this sort of reference we can see that Kane s main character is driven primarily by the individualistic levels shown above on the left especially the red level 3 values of self assertion and accumulation of wealth and power It s A Wonderful Life on the other hand shows a character repeatedly torn between the individualistic levels and the more community focused ones George Bailey is confronted with a series of choices over the course of the film each one offering him a fresh opportunity to turn from community values to assertion of his individuality He wants to leave Bedford Falls go to college learn engineering see the world build grand things go to war and be a part of large and ambitious enterprises Instead he stays in his home town runs the local building and loan helps those of low estate buy their first homes marries a girl from the same small town lives in an old ramshackle home and serves as the town s air raid warden during the war Each time George is offered a chance to embark on a journey to make his mark on the wider world outside Bedford Falls community values tug on him and he decides to stay The conclusion of the film attempts to integrate the community focused values with the individualistic ones demonstrating that George has achieved Survival Significance and Prosperity even while staying within his small local community George s brother toasts him as the richest man in town and the inscription in Clarence the Angel s gift tells him Remember no one is a failure who has friends And so both films through different character types and different narrative arcs show us the play of these various cultural forces in American society And both conclude roughly speaking by showing us the emptiness of pursuing purely individualistic goals without some concomitant focus on the value of community In many respects the character of Charles Foster Kane was based on the life of William Randolph Hearst However Orson Welles clarified that the character was drawn from a number of sources as well as incorporating original inventions I would suggest that the character is really best understood as an enduring American archetype exemplifying the individualistic side of the developmental spiral depicted above I don t have to look far to find real life examples of the archetypes and cultural forces featured in these two classic films As I reflect on my personal history it s clear that my own parents demonstrated the tension between these two sides of the spiral My mom was very much a Donna Reed sort of character out of It s A Wonderful Life focused on values of family and community and tradition My father as wonderful as he was was an example of how George Bailey might have turned out if at every turn he had taken the more individualist fork in the road Dad got out of farm country in Iowa as fast as his Ford and his Engineering degree would take him He moved frequently up and down the East and West Coasts changed jobs often and owned a series of power boats all given various generations of the Travel On name He divorced my mother when I was nine years of age and moved on to a wife who was in many ways similar to Kane s mistress and second wife Susan Alexander Of course none of us need to look much beyond the daily headlines to see examples of how this tension between individualistic expression and community support are showing up in our society today Billionaries assert their individuality and power forsaking any attachment to community while rural towns all over the country come more and more

		content: "The invasion of our Capitol building on January 6th 2021 and the accompanying disruption of the work of our duly elected members of Congress was certainly an unprecedented and frightening addition to our American history books And yet when added to the list of coup attempts that have taken place around the world throughout human history coups this action seems a bit out of place The New Oxford American Dictionary on my Mac defines the word coup in several ways with the first entry going like this > also coup d état a sudden violent and illegal seizure of power from a government he was overthrown in an army coup And yet despite all of the terrifying and shocking things we witnessed during this day the one thing we didn t see was any serious attempt to seize power or to overthrow our government In fact the end game of the protestors seemed to simply be to storm the gates of our nation s Capitol building in order to take selfies And neither they nor their leaders as far as observers can discern had any practical or effective plans for seizing or retaining power The third entry for coup in my dictionary might at first seem a more appropriate way to describe what happened on this day > historical among some North American Indian peoples an act of touching an armed enemy in battle as a deed of bravery or an act of first touching an item of the enemy s in order to claim it In other words the Trump inspired protestors were only interested in making a symbolic gesture and not in seizing any actual power And yet I am loath to apply this meaning of the term to what happened in our nation s capital on January 6th for fear of giving legitimate offense to native Americans whose forebears no doubt engaged in such actions with more honor and self awareness than can likely be ascribed to any of the protestors who illegally breached the defenses of our Capitol building on the occasion in question In fact their actions while deranged and dangerous did not quite rise to the level of any reasonable definition of a coup or even a coup attempt If we re looking for comparable sorts of actions we might do better recalling the Yippies of the sixties and the protests outside of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago Of course the Yippies were more self aware of their overtly theatrical intentions than were the members of the mob that assaulted our democracy on the 6th But both groups seemed to view political structures of any kind to be highly suspect and not worthy of serious engagement There is though I fear a difference wrought by the intervening years and not a good one The Yippies understood that they were engaging in a form of political theatre and realized the distinction between play acting and reality For both Trump and his dedicated followers however and perhaps for much of our society in this third decade of the 21st century there seems to be little cerebral differentiation between play acting and the real thing So much of our public attention is devoted to posturing puffoonery ^1 and empty opinionizing that many of our citizens seem to have lost the ability to distinguish this sort of behavior from actions that have real world consequences But can we pretend surprise The attack on the Capitol was preceded by speeches from Trump and his associates who were pretending that Trump had actually been elected to a second term by a majority of American voters and a majority of the Electoral College And they were followed by a long winded speech from Mitch McConnell mitch full of mock outrage over the actions of the President and his followers And the following votes included numerous Republicans who pretended to question the validity of the electoral results from some of the states And the Democrats responded by pretending that Pence and Trump s cabinet might actually invoke the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office And the Capitol police at least to many outside observers seemed at times to only be pretending to defend the perimeter of the building they were supposed to be securing And of course all of this was preceded by years of the entire Republican party pretending to have the best interests of most Americans at heart And then for the last four years our country has been led by a president whose success at every improbable turn in his career has been built upon a towering series of acts of pretense probably best summarized by his stint pretending to be a business leader in his role on The Apprentice but leading eventually to his defenders and interpeters legitimizing the notion of alternative facts altfacts in order to explain his improbable assertions more plainly referred to as a pack of lies and culminating with some finality we can only hope in the tragic acts on January 6th that amounted to a make believe coup I just read this morning that the CEO of a marketing consultancy apologized for his actions after being arrested by saying ruk I followed hundreds of others through an open set of doors to the Capitol building to see what was taking place inside This person s perceptions seem to epitomize the moment in which we find ourselves as our leaders prove willing to open the doors to heretofore unimaginable possibilities and so many find themselves unable to resist the temptation to follow the crowds to see what sort of thrills might await them just on the other side of those doors where the lines between fantasy and reality between observation and participation between actions and consequences have all vanished into the smoke of the conjurer s trick Make no mistake the 45th president of our United States aided and abetted by Republican politicians and right wing news media has led many of his followers as well as himself up to and even over the brink of a sort of delusional madness and it is up to all of us to pull ourselves and as many of our fellow citizens as we can save back from the gaping maw It is time for all of us to move beyond partisan politics and tribal squabbles to find reality based common ground and take real actions that will have real consequences Nothing less will save our nation ^1 Yes I m aware that puffoonery is not a real word I just made it up But it seems like it should be I use it to mean a contrived inflation of the importance of things and people that is so extreme and habitual as to border on the comic

		title: "Cooperation Competition and Coercion",
		date: "17 Jul 2020",
    url: "blog/hbowie/cooperation-competition-and-coercion.html",
		content: "Let s take a closer look at some of the major ideas regularly animating our public discourse today Cooperation vs Competition When we contemplate the society in which we live we often tend to frame our disagreements in terms of cooperation vs competition Are we working together collaboratively with others or are we competing with them Politically those on the left tend to be associated with a spirit of egalitarian cooperation while those on the right are often viewed as proponents of unrestrained competition within a free market economy From an economic perspective these alternatives can be portrayed as a choice between centralized planning or laissez faire capitalism The tension between these two alternatives can be somewhat resolved through reference to multi level selection theory mls pointing out that we can cooperate at some levels say within a company and compete at others between companies for example In our current state of polarizing identity politics those favoring cooperation can easily be portrayed as socialist defenders of society s freeloaders while those arguing for unrestrained competition can be painted as standard bearers for a true economic meritocracy And even when viewing things from a somewhat more enlightened perspective these labels still seem to trap us between two poles leading us to describe any sort of alternative as a third way 3rdway of some kind Coercion But when we look at the major societal choices facing us today and the major political battles in front of us I m starting to think the primary question is not really whether we want a society that is more cooperative vs one that is more competitive but rather the following Are we ready for a society that is less coercive When we see a policeman choking the life out of someone floyd by kneeling on his neck until they can no longer even beg for breath that is an example of coercion by violent force And when that act of murder is done in front of a crowd of onlookers floyd2 some of whom are capturing the entire sequence on video it is an example of coercion through a threat of violence to others in that community And when millions of people are denied access to housing to clean water water to nutritious food hunger and to healthcare or forced to work eighty or 100 or 120 hours per week just to keep their heads above water that is an example of coercion through critical resource deprivation And when women are persuaded or forced into sexual submission by those in power metoo either to avoid bodily harm or to avoid termination of their careers those acts are also examples of coercion either through violence threats of violence or threats of critical resource deprivation And when we see police and our national guard being called out to resist peaceful protesters wearing full riot gear and using tear gas and flash grenades to disperse protestors lafayette and arresting card carrying journalists journalists and forcing protestors into unmarked vehicles portland we see further examples of coercion And when we look at the levels of gun ownership in the US gunown and listen to the reasons why people in the US seem to think they need so many guns the most impassioned defenses of Second Amendment rights all revolve around the ability of citizens to defend themselves against coercion gundefense either from our government or from criminals And when we study the levels of incarceration in the US jail we are again viewing examples of violent coercion on a massive scale And when we regard the growing levels of wealth inequality in this country wealth we are seeing an example of large scale coercion through critical resource deprivation And so when viewing the current political moment including all of the protests telling us that Black Lives Matter blm and now asking for defunding of the police defund we are seeing something that cannot be framed in terms of traditional arguments pitting progressives against conservatives No what we are seeing I believe is a broad and deep revulsion over the levels of coercion now underpinning our entire American society And along with this revulsion a deep questioning If we have gotten rid of slavery and have signed on to provide equal rights to all Americans then why do we continue to need this level of coercion in our society If we are now the land of the free not just for white males but for all of us then why do we need so much coercive power and why do we need to exercise it so often The Alternative All of this is perhaps why economist Peter Boettke when prompted recently by evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson to cast judgment on laissez faire capitalism responded that he did not see our current societal problems primarily through this lens boettke > I see instead a world of a permanent war economy manipulation of money and credit and rent seeking society that privileges some at the expense of others all of which distort and damage our politics our markets and our society In essence Power and Privilege have been amassed in an effort to govern over rather than a self governing democratic era where we dissipate power and deny privilege and seek to govern with each other as dignified equals True liberalism in this sense would be seen as the emancipatory philosophy that it was written to be seeking to eradicate the bonds of oppression imposed by the Altar the Crown the Sword and from both crushing poverty and the protected privileges of the mercantilist class And so we have to ask if we were to eradicate the bonds of oppression in our society and eliminate privilege and distribute power fairly so that we can govern with each other as dignified equals then would we really need the levels of coercion we are seeing all around us today Would we really need to have the highest prison population in the world even greater than that of Russia and China And so I think people are beginning to sense that the solution to a fear of coercion cannot continually be more coercion It is as if our own society was locked into an arms race arms with itself when an armed shooter invades a school we respond by trying to put armed police in every school in the country But where does this lead Where has it already led Perhaps this is why Seattle police chief Carmen Best recently remarked on a national news show best > But what I believe especially after I was at a march the day before yesterday with Black Lives Matter and I was looking at the 60 000 people that were there with signs saying defund the police stop police brutality no qualified immunity and there were thousands of people carrying those particular signs and I just realized it was a pivotal moment in history We are going to move in a different direction and policing will never be the same as it was before And so perhaps we can dare to hope that we are truly turning a corner in our American society that what we are seeing is not just another pendulum swing from right to left and back again but a moment in time when we can begin to dial back the levels of coercion running rampant throughout our country and start to work our way back to the untarnished ideals that our country s early leaders expressed on paper even if the reality has been so long deferred the notion that all humans are created equal with rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the idea that we can have government of by and for the people For if we can achieve a society that truly embodies these emancipatory ideals then I can but pray that coercion

		content: "In a recent post on Understanding Human History understanding human history html I asserted that our story can be seen as a progressive spiral made up of four intertwining strands with the third consisting of communication mechanisms organizational structures and other means for enhancing human cooperation In a following post I defined some of what I see in this third strand as basic Patterns of Human Cooperation patterns of human cooperation html that have evolved over the centuries Now I d like to dive a little deeper and talk about the fundamental organizational principles that make for effective cooperation within groups of humans Luckily a lot of the heavy lifting here has already been done for us I m drawing today on the Nobel prize winning work done by the political economist Elinor Ostrom https en wikipedia org wiki Elinor Ostrom as interpreted and updated by evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson and his pals at Prosocial World https www prosocial world with some paraphrasing from me In order to understand the importance of these principles we need to first appreciate the importance of teaming within the development of humanity Wilson speaks to this in his book This View of Life Completing the Darwinian Revolution https amzn to 2xkpCPl > Multilevel selection theory tells us that something similar to team level selection took place in our species for thousands of generations resulting in adaptations for teamwork that are baked into the genetic architecture of our minds Absorbing this fact leads to the conclusion that small groups are a fundamental unit of human social organization Individuals cannot be understood except in the context of small groups and large scale societies need to be seen as a kind of multicellular organism comprising small groups What this means is that as human beings we are hard wired not to compete and survive as individuals but to work together cooperatively as members of small teams And what makes this sort of teaming work Wilson and his colleagues following the path forged by Ostrom define what they call the eight Core Design Principles CDPs for human teaming 1 Strong Group Identity with Clearly Defined Boundaries This includes a shared understanding of the team s goals the boundaries of their resources and the rights and obligations of being a team member 2 Proportional Equivalence Between Benefits and Costs Team members must be fairly rewarded based on their contributions 3 Fair and Inclusive Decision Making Everyone gets a chance to participate in decision making and decisions are made in a way recognized by all to be fair Also decisions are made at the lowest possible level both to confer a sense of empowerment but also to allow decisions to be made based on local circumstances best known and appreciated by the team itself 4 Monitoring Agreed Upon Behaviors The team must have a way of monitoring members and detecting deviations from accepted norms 5 Graduated Sanctions This may start as friendly pressure from peers but then may proceed to more serious consequences if negative behavior persists 6 Fast and Fair Conflict Resolution When conflicts arise teams must have a way to resolve them quickly and in a manner seen as fair 7 Local Autonomy Teams must have the freedom to conduct their own affairs without undue external interference 8 Polycentric Governance In large organizations that consist of multiple teams relationships among teams must embody the same principles as the relationships among individuals within each team This means that the core design principles above are scale independent It s interesting to note that Ostrom s research was based on observations of the actual success and failure of many small teams rather than on the invention of increasingly complex formulas and models often favored by traditional economists These Core Design Principles provide a valuable framework that can be used to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of teams organizations and societies And while these principles may seem obvious or intuitive to many that does not mean that they are uniformly applied even well informed and well intentioned teams can unconsciously stray from these principles over time and so this list may well be a valuable reference that teams coaches and team leaders can use to evaluate and favorably adjust the operations of their groups from time to time I ve excerpted some of Wilson s work in this short piece but in doing so I certainly haven t cherry picked all the good stuff I can enthusiastically recommend his book This View of Life Completing the Darwinian Revolution https amzn to 2xkpCPl to everyone reading this not just for its insights into the workings of teams but perhaps even more importantly for insights into what it means to be human in the 21st century"

		title: "Cultural Evolution",

    url: "blog/hbowie/cultural-evolution.html",
		content: "Let s talk a bit about cultural evolution to find out why this idea is so important What We Mean by Human Culture First of all what do we mean by culture Wikipedia s entry wp offers a useful summary > Culture encompasses the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in human societies The concept of material culture covers the physical expressions of culture such as technology architecture and art whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization including practices of political organization and social institutions mythology philosophy literature both written and oral and science comprise the intangible cultural heritage of a society In other words culture consists of the knowledge beliefs artifacts attitudes practices and institutions that are shared by a group of people and transmitted socially between members of that group The Importance of Human Culture When we think about a definition like this one thing becomes clear pretty quickly most of what makes up our daily lives as human beings falls somewhere into this cultural category Remove these cultural elements language science buildings tools food preparation techniques social norms works of art and whatever we have left is something most of us would barely recognize as human I recently made a point of rewatching the 1970 film by François Truffaut The Wild Child twc Truffaut s narrative was based on a true story of a French doctor who in 1798 took in a boy of 11 or 12 who had grown up in the forest without any sort of human contact The child was first placed in a home for deaf mutes with doctors assuming that his inability to speak or react to human speech was due to some physical and or mental incapacity However Dr Jean Itard played by Truffaut had a different idea and persuaded the authorities to allow the boy to live with him The film then follows the boy s slow but evident progress as Dr Itard invests the time and effort necessary to teach the boy the basics of life in human society The film s message is clear whatever we think it means to be human we are not born that way but only achieve some measure of humanity to the degree that we are carefully raised and socialized by other caring humans The Malleability of Human Culture Of course almost all of us are brought up within some particular human culture At first we have our hands and minds full just learning that one culture in which we were raised If that education is successful then we reach a point at which we take most cultural elements for granted like a fish swimming through the ocean we move through the culture that surrounds us giving it no more thought than the fish gives the water in which it lives At a later stage in our development though we may perhaps notice that the cultural elements we ve taken for granted are not fixed in stone Here s the way Steve Jobs phrased it jobs > When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world Try not to bash into the walls too much Try to have a nice family have fun save a little money > > That s a very limited life Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it you can influence it you can build your own things that other people can use And here s a historian s perspective on the issue from Yuval Noah Harari s book Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind sapiens > The heated debates about Homo sapiens natural way of life miss the main point Ever since the Cognitive Revolution there hasn t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens There are only cultural choices from among a bewildering palette of possibilities And here s a relevant observation by Eamonn Kelly a strategic business consultant from his book Powerful times Rising to the Challenge of our Uncertain World kelly > Perhaps the greatest cognitive barrier we face in making sense of the world is that we have come to view certain realities as part of a natural order that will remain unchallenged In fact many fundamental truths that we take for granted are simply the fragile constructs of history and could shift radically in the decade ahead Cultural Change Over Time Of course culture is often dependent on the part of the world in which we happen to find ourselves And it can also vary from group to group within a region a company can be said to have a certain corporate culture for example As we look back over the course of human history however the works of anthropologists and historians tell us that cultures have also changed over time Discoveries have been made Inventions have been created Vehicles have been designed built and used for transportation Words have been added to our languages Books have been written New means of communication have been constructed Buildings and institutions have been erected Roads bridges and dams have been built Wars have been fought and invasions have occurred New forms of social organization have been launched As we study the broad pattern of these sorts of changes over long periods of time one may gradually observe that they seem to follow many of the same patterns that occur in biological evolution evo In other words various cultural elements change over time to provide humans with better adaptations to their environments and various cultures compete with one another with the cultural elements providing the best environmental fit generally predominating over others that work not quite so well In other words cultures don t merely change they evolve Here s how Professor Jürgen Klüver describes it from a report in 2008 embo > Many biologists and social scientists have noted that with the development of human culture the biological evolution of Homo sapiens was usurped by socio cultural evolution The construction of artificial environments and social structures created new criteria for selection and biological fitness was replaced by cultural fitness And many observers note that this ability to leverage cultural evolution has given humanity a decisive advantage in our competition with other species Here s how Edwin G Pulleyblank puts it in a book from 1989 pulleyblank > Our capacity through language to manipulate the mental world and so deal imaginatively with the world of experience has been a major factor perhaps the major factor in giving humans the overwhelming advantage over other species in terms of cultural as opposed to biological evolution The Interrelationship of Cultural Elements While at times we may consider each cultural strand in isolation from others there often seems to be an interrelationship between them As our understanding of the universe has grown through scientific discoveries for example that understanding has in turn influenced our religious beliefs and social institutions As machines have been developed to perform work requiring physical strength the nature of work has shifted resulting in broader and deeper education throughout society As technology and industry have brought greater prosperity to more of society our respect for the value of individuals within those societies has grown Here s a comment from Harari again from Sapiens describing how some of these strands have tied together > Myths it transpired are stronger than anyone could have imagined When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires people invented stories about great gods motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail s pace the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation unlike any other ever seen on earth Developmental Models Taking all of this into account some observers have noted that these various strands of human culture have coevolved through a series of developmental levels You can read more about these here Developmental Levels dl A brief overview of developmental levels as described by Clare W Graves Don Beck Chris Cowan and Ken Wilber Developmental Levels as Evolving Social Structures dlss A view of developmental levels as a series of evolving social structures These levels really represent different patterns of human engagement all of which are still in operation today in all of our societies and so an understanding of these levels patterns can help us all better understand how and why humans interact in various ways Individual Responsibility So how are we to think about human culture and our role in it To some extent of course we are all part of a culture created by others who preceded us and we would be nothing without these cultural gifts that have been handed down to us As Dr Martin Luther King Jr put it in a sermon on Conquering Self Centeredness king > No matter where you stand no matter how much popularity you have no matter how much education you have no matter how much money you have you have it because somebody in this universe helped you to get it And when you see that you can t be arrogant you can t be supercilious You discover that you have your position because of the events of history and because of individuals in the background making it possible for you to stand there Albert Einstein took this thinking a bit farther einstein reflecting not only on our fortunate heritage but the obligations such gifts impose upon us > How strange is the lot of us mortals Each of us is here for a brief sojourn for what purpose he knows not though he sometimes thinks he senses it But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people first of all for those upon whose smiles and well being our own happiness is wholly dependent and then for the many unknown to us to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men living and dead and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving Novelist Kurt Vonnegut further commented kv on our ability to change our own culture > It s only recently that I ve come to understand that writers are not marginal to our society that they in fact do all our thinking for us that we are writing myths and our myths are believed and that old myths are believed until someone writes a new one And finally famed cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead weighs in > Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world Indeed it is the only thing that ever has Summary In summary here are a number of ideas I ve presented that are all tied to the topic of cultural evolution Culture consists of the knowledge beliefs artifacts attitudes practices and institutions that are shared by a group of people and transmitted socially between members of that group When we consider our humanity we find ourselves primarily considering the cultural dimension of our existence Our cultures are not fixed or predetermined but are susceptible to change Our human cultures have evolved over time While we can examine various cultural strands in isolation many of them are related to each other and have influenced each other as they have evolved Various developmental models have been constructed to paint our common cultural evolution in very broad strokes While all of us inherit a certain culture we also have the ability and perhaps even the responsibility to contribute in turn to the further evolution of that culture

		title: "The Dangers of Political Nostalgia",

    url: "blog/hbowie/the-dangers-of-political-nostalgia.html",
		content: "Former Vice President and presidential hopeful Joe Biden recently got himself in some hot water with progressives biden by publicly indulging in a bit of nostalgia for the good old days when elected representatives in DC could engage in civil discourse and get things done even when they violently disagreed with one another I m not quite as old as Biden and I ve never served in public office but I can still share his nostalgia for seemingly simpler times when our political leaders displayed some sort of respect for each other even when they disagreed over issues of state However it s one thing to reveal a preference for certain elements of those bygone days but quite another to base your presidential run on wishful thinking that those lost elements can somehow be restored in the third decade of the 21st century Both Joe Biden and Howard Schultz seem taken by this idea that a centrist presidency can somehow restore this lost era of civility and bring both sides of the aisle to the table to engage in productive common sense discussions for the good of the country as a whole Such a scenario plays well as a work of fiction hence the return of the TV series Designated Survivor for a third season but there are elements of our modern times that make it impossible for such a scenario to play out in current reality Mind the Gap These previous times to which Biden and Schultz want to return featured a well understood process for making governmental decisions This process looked something like this 1 Introduction of a topic 2 Sharing of varied perspectives 3 Discussion of alternatives 4 Formation of positions 5 Preparation for a decision lining up allies calling in favors tallying likely votes 6 The actual vote and the announcement of the consequent action 7 Formation of a cohesive public narrative about what happened including both factual reporting and Op Ed pieces Some of these steps might have overlapped but still there was a gap between the start and end of this process leaving time for these various phases to occur as distinctly different sorts of activities each given their proper due Today there is no gap Take as example the recent US decision to not attack Iran iran We all woke up one morning to reports of Trump s latest tweets and saw all of these steps compressed into a single series of short public pronouncements directly from our commander in chief up to and including the presentation of the prescribed narrative lens through which we should view these events All our news media could do no matter which channel or station or network you chose was to dutifully report the content of these tweets repeatedly throughout the day And while this might seem an extreme example it is a representative one All steps of our political process today are taken with a single thought in mind how this will look how this will sound how this will play in the news media And so there is no opportunity to give steps 1 6 their due no matter how fervently we might wish for such an opportunity And there seems no way to turn back the clock on any of this This is just a basic element of our modern competitive 24 hour cycle of news and commentary delivered relentlessly by our phones our computer screens our radios our print media and our televisions The Loss of Genuine Regional Differences Back in those lost days that Biden pines for there were very genuine regional differences of perspective in our country Take for example the presidential election of 1968 pres68 George Wallace ran on an openly segregationist platform and he won a predictable bloc of Southern states As anyone who has watched the recent film The Green Book gbook might understand those were times when the perspectives on issues like civil rights varied sharply in different parts of our country and there was often a lack of understanding of those differences until they were actually confronted These genuine regional differences formed because a person s understanding of the world around them back then was based much more on face to face discussions with neighbors and coworkers and on consumption of news from local outlets There was no social media no USA Today no CNN no internet no cable television This loss of regional identity was brought home to me recently when I met someone who had attended the same midwestern college I had but had originally hailed from a southern state I commented that she didn t seem to have much of an accent and she smiled at me a bit condescendingly I thought and explained without the slightest hint of a drawl that she had been raised in a big city in the South You can see this change as well in the results of the 2016 presidential election pres16 Even though diversity and inclusion were certainly defining issues for both candidates as they were for Wallace in 68 Trump s victory included a far broader swath of states and ones that fell into no neat regional categories The West Coast went for Clinton and the South went for Trump but closer examination by county pres16c reveals that the political divisions were much more along urban suburban rural lines than along strictly regional ones And so whereas back in the sixties politicians traveling to DC had genuinely differing regional perspectives to share and explore with one another today s politicians especially in the Senate no longer have real regional identities that they are representing Instead these have been largely replaced by national party loyalties which are already well defined and battle hardened leaving little room for any sincere discussion Again any thoughts of turning back the clock in this regard lack any solid grounding in reality At Least One Party of Extreme Fundamentalists Republicans in recent years have thoroughly adopted the thinking that Democrats liberals progressives of all stripes are less than human and represent a fundamental and existential attack on all that is good and decent about American society Based on this sort of thinking Republicans have consistently taken the position that the goal of political victory is so important that it justifies any means taken to achieve it no matter what laws or rules or expectations of fairness and decency must be broken to achieve it The current drama playing out in Oregon oregon is evidence of both this point and the one above with Republican state senators heading for the hills and hiding out in order to deny the Democratic majority the ability to lawfully pass a cap and trade bill A president like Donald Trump is the inevitable consequence of this line of reasoning No matter whether our current crop of Republicans are actually aligned with Trump or only pretending to fully support him Kurt Vonnegut s conclusion from the novel Mother Night mother still applies > We are what we pretend to be so we must be careful about what we pretend to be The current Republican party has not been careful about what it pretends to be and it seems unlikely that any of their current elected representatives are capable of being somehow redeemed and turned overnight back into honest upstanding citizens capable of open inquisitive and respectful debate I am certainly not claiming that all Democrats are solidly above similar sorts of political warfare far from it But no matter how much potential might or might not exist on the Democratic side of the aisle there is no prospect at all of redemption on the Republican side And so it will not be possible to suddenly turn back the clock here either especially in a single election cycle We may not like trench warfare but it s what we ve got for now and we ve got to first survive the trenches before we can begin to contemplate some sort of more refined discussion and debate in the halls of Congress Dangerous Delusions It is a common fallacy to imagine our presidents have more power than they actually possess one reason for our frequent disillusionment with them During our current election cycle some of our older candidates seem to be basing their centrist campaigns on the delusion that once elected to this office they will gain the power to suddenly restore civility to our national political arena But no matter how many reruns of Designated Survivor they watch there are forces at play in our modern society that allow no chance at all of such a narrative playing out in real life With so much at stake in our upcoming national elections there is no room for magical thinking We have to base our political calculations on the way things are today not the way we wish they were or the way they used to be at some point in the now far distant past If our candidates really wish to learn something useful from the sixties they might be better off refreshing their memories of

		title: "The Decline of the Republican Party First Gradually and then Suddenly",
		date: "07 Apr 2021",
    url: "blog/hbowie/the-decline-of-the-republican-party-first-gradually-and-then-suddenly.html",
		content: "Ernest Hemingway supplied two of his characters in The Sun Also Rises with a pair of memorably terse lines > How did you go bankrupt Bill asked > > Two ways Mike said Gradually and then suddenly Mike s answer has been quoted endlessly since then probably because it seems to perfectly encapsulate a recurring modern sensation of having things firmly under control then seeing them start to slip slowly from our grasp and then the next minute realizing we ve lost hold completely And now in 2021 the modern Republican Party seems to be taking its turn in Mike s spot sliding slowly and soon suddenly downwards along this sort of trajectory Let s examine some of the indicators Ideological Bankruptcy Just today I saw reported a Fox News interview in which host Chris Wallace challenged Senator Roy Blunt blunt over his attacks on the Biden infrastructure plan suggesting that the Republicans had lost all credibility when it comes to concerns about our national debt since it had increased by more than $3 trillion during the Trump presidency even before the pandemic hit And then there are the increasing volumes of data trickle indicating that the trickle down theory of economics touted by so many Republicans has been a consistent and abject failure in terms of providing prosperity for anyone other than the very rich And then there s the repeated Republican insistence they they are pro life even though their willingness to provide societal support for the young seems to end as soon as they are born based on their unwillingness to ensure adequate food water housing or education for the children of our nation kids I could go on but the bottom line here is that the Republicans seem to have abandoned any worthwhile ideas or principles they might have once had and settled instead for a grab bag of resentments that they can use to try to motivate their fragmented base This worked in the 2016 elections but it failed in 2020 and it will be hard to motivate more than half of our nation s voters with this sort of strategy unless the Democrats blunder horribly Dependence on Misinformation Republicans have grown totally dependent on right wing news media willing to feed their followers a steady stream of misinformation However it was noted back in 1684 fool that One can fool some men or fool all men in some places and times but one cannot fool all men in all places and ages Often misquoted and misattributed as You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time but you cannot fool all the people all the time This is arguably even more true today in the age of the Internet when up to date reliable information as well as utter nonsense is so readily available The Republicans have been relying on this steady stream of manufactured news for so long that I think they have lost touch with reality as reported to and apprehended by most Americans But this carefully contrived bubble of misinformation cannot have significant influence forever and its acceptance seems to be on the wane Disconnection from Modern Business Republicans were apparently caught by surprise when Major League Baseball announced mlb their decision to move the 2021 All Star Game out of Atlanta in response to Georgia s passing of a new piece of legislation very obviously and specifically designed to disenfranchise people of color people who came out in record numbers recently in order to send two Democratic Senators to the US Congress It is enlightening to view Mitch McConnell s response mcc to this sort of corporate decision making Here are a couple of widely quoted summarizing sentences from his press release on the subject > From election law to environmentalism to radical social agendas to the Second Amendment parts of the private sector keep dabbling in behaving like a woke parallel government Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order This is utterly amazing language to use to describe a company s decision to disassociate itself from a state in which a Republican controlled legislature is using its power to make it harder for people to vote amazing at least to anyone not fully plugged in to the latest talking points being promoted by the right wing propaganda machines Of course when large companies and wealthy capitalists pour money into the coffers of conservative PACs and Republican election campaigns situations in which this sort of language might actually make some sense concerned voices from Republicans such as McConnell are notably absent But threats from Republicans will not be enough to convince large organization such as Major League Baseball to get back into line We can debate whether corporate outrage has any basis in deep seated principles or not but the answer to that question is largely irrelevant What the Republicans are missing is the fact that what companies need these days more than tax breaks and favorable regulation is the trust and good will of their customers as well as current and prospective employees And so when confronted they cannot afford to be on the wrong side of diversity inclusion and equity issues Because let s face it if their pools of employees and customers were drawn solely from those watching Fox News twelve hours a day they would not stay in business for very long Naked Avarice As the last shreds of ideological rationale are torn away and as the right wing media machine continues to generate talking points more and more divorced from reality and as business leaders begin to distance themselves from increasingly brazen attempts by Republicans to subvert our democracy voting what is increasingly revealed to voters is simply naked avarice Witness the news that the Trump campaign tricked supporters trick into changing their one time donations into silently recurring ones Or the news about Ted Cruz and his family cancun vacationing in Cancun while many of his supporters were trying to stay safe in freezing weather in Texas Or the news that Matt Gaetz had boasted repeatedly gaetz about his access to women provided by a county tax collector now charged with sex trafficking of a minor A Leadership Vacuum Where are the Republican leaders who might steer the ship back into safer waters Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016 because of a lack of credible competitors and when we survey the field now all we find is Trump himself as well as a host of Trump Mini Me s The basic problem here is that voters ultimately want a candidate able to demonstrate some degree of character and integrity but Republicans have painted themselves into a corner an outdated corner full of misinformation but absent any useful ideas from which such qualities are unlikely to emerge First Gradually and then Suddenly When I survey the state of Republican leadership I am reminded of a quote from a Ross MacDonald novel I read recently The Zebra Striped Hearse > Blackwell was a sad and troubled man hardly competent to play God with anybody s life But the sadder and more troubled they were the more they yearned for omnipotence The really troubled ones believed they had it The Republicans have held a degree of omnipotence for some time now controlling most state governments and at least one branch of our federal government enough to block any form of progress And their response to corporations pulling investments away from Georgia indicates that they still think they have absolute power But a belief in their own omnipotence is one notable reason why the Mikes of our world first see their fortunes slipping away gradually and then suddenly by the time they realize they are no longer all powerful it is too

		content: "Democracy is a means of governance over a society that places the reins of power in the hands of the people humanism being governed Direct democracy is possible for the smallest societies but in our modern world and at larger scales representative democracies are generally more widely practiced Democracy as a core value is clearly and directly tied to the companion belief in equality And democracy works best when accompanied by beliefs in the value of education critical thinking ct the rule of law rol science and a systemic approach to solving society s problems Less obviously perhaps democracy is strongly tied to the core principle of imperfection this is why Winston Churchill once wryly observed > Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried The imperfections of democracy are often painfully obvious You wouldn t want all the passengers on an aircraft to decide on the plane s design through a democratic process why leave it up to all of society s passengers to collectively second guess decisions about how to best run our large and complex modern governments And if you were interested in quick and decisive decision making you wouldn t want to turn such decisions over to large bodies of elected legislators But confessions of inevitable imperfection are even more deeply woven into the value of democracy because such ideals depend entirely on a shared sense of humility an acknowledgment that none of us has perfect knowledge or perfect decision making capabilities What s more the principle of imperfection forces us to accept however reluctantly that the idea of a perfect government is a chimera whose apparent charms are to be avoided at all costs because such fantasies are always promoted by charlatans who would like to convince us to permanently turn over all of our decision making powers to certain individuals or to a preferred political party or to an anointed social class This is why all modern democracies depend on a balance of power between different branches of government and different levels of government and different political parties because all of human history has taught us that when too much power is concentrated in too few hands terrible things eventually happen And so our democracies continue to bumble along steering various erratic courses between problematic extremes first lurching to the left and then back to the right often making mistakes and yet unlike all other forms of government that have been tried generally managing to avoid running entirely into the ditch It should be noted though that a belief in the value of democracy is not necessarily accompanied by a similar valuation for all dimensions of diversity As the most obvious example any democracy is dependent upon a common language that can be spoken and read by all of its citizens how else can they hope to be informed and to engage in civil discourse and to be cognizant of applicable laws and regulations But going further it may be hard for a democracy to accommodate other dimensions of diversity For example American political scientist Danielle Allen as quoted by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt in their 2018 book How Democracies Die makes the following observation allen > The simple fact of the matter is that the world has never built a multiethnic democracy in which no particular ethnic group is in the majority and where political equality social equality and economies that empower all have been achieved A tolerance for and appreciation of ethnic religious and other dimensions of diversity are admirable goals but as we stretch our democracies to accommodate these we must also strive to find other unifying factors that will help to promote enough social cohesion to make most citizens feel a sense of shared values and a shared destiny allen https www washingtonpost com opinions charlottesville is not the continuation of an old fight it is something new 2017 08 13 971812f6 8029 11e7 b359 15a3617c767b story html balance tags balance html ct tags critical thinking html democracy tags democracy html diversity tags diversity html education tags education html equality tags equality html imperfection tags imperfection html rol tags rule of law html science tags science html systemic tags systemic html governance tags governance html society tags society html humanism tags humanism html"

		date: "27 Dec 2019",
    url: "blog/hbowie/dethroning-the-false-god-of-user-experience-design.html",
		content: "My first personal computer was an Osborne 1 os1 It came with not only a CP M operating system but copies of SuperCalc WordStar and two versions of the BASIC programming language both CBASIC and MBASIC I even convinced my Dad to buy one of these things and he happily used both SuperCalc and WordStar for years to put together spreadsheets and documents for his real estate business While these devices seem ancient and massively underwhelming by today s standards the acquisition of a computer such as this arguably represented the single greatest leap forward in the history of personal computing It s hard to picture today but before this individuals had to put together spreadsheets by hand and add up columns of numbers using a calculator and produce letters and other documents using a typewriter The Osborne 1 was released in 1981 It would be nine years later before Steve Jobs would conclude that a computer is like a bicycle for the mind mindbike And it would be midway through the 1990 s before Donald Norman would popularize the phrase user experience leading to the idea of UX design and the role of UX designer and the eventual enshrinement of the notion that users need to have their experiences with computers designed for them by cadres of highly trained specialists uxdesign Looking back on all these events from our modern perspective the overall arc may seems natural and even preordained with each achievement along the personal computing timeline smoothly leading to the next The problem though is that we ve had something valuable stolen from us along the way And the whole modern notion of UX design is one of the thieves that has robbed us Let s go back to the core of what Steve Jobs was saying back in 1990 1 Tool building is an intrinsic part of what makes us human what separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom 2 The computer is the greatest tool that humans have ever invented And implicit here I think is another statement 3 Tools are used to build things including other tools And yet if we look around us today in 2019 and see what computers are being used for how much of that activity could be considered building I mean it s wonderful that Apple s holiday ad captures an epic snowball fight filmed completely with an iPhone 11 snowbrawl but how many of the iPhones around you are being used for similarly creative tasks Back in 1990 Jobs pointed out that what a human needed to beat a condor in a race was a bicycle today the human might have a better chance if he gave the condor an iPhone and downloaded a few apps for him the condor would never even make it off the couch And so if our modern computing devices are not being used for purposes fit for humanity at its height then what went wrong Consider that in the quotation from Jobs there is no mention of a user Instead he casts all humans as tool builders and presents the personal computer as the ultimate tool Contrast this with the summary definition of User Experience found on the website for the Nielsen Norman Group nng > User Experience encompasses all aspects of the end user s interaction with the company its services and its products Notice now that most humans are no longer tool builders but are end users The use of the term end in this context is especially revealing because it implies that a whole chain of building has preceded the delivery of a company s products and services but that the focus of UX design is on the user who sits at the very end of the line In other words whatever this recipient will be doing with these products and services s he certainly won t be building anything new that will then be passed on to others Notice also that the focus is now on designing an experience for the end user How precious It now seems that our users need not do anything useful with the computers they ve been allowed to access instead the focus is on providing them with a high quality experience that has been precisely designed to go far beyond giving customers what they say they want And so our poor computer using humans considered the crown of creation in Jobs words have now been reduced to the point where they cannot even be trusted to reliably express what it is they want from their interactions with a computer No their experience must be designed for them by the seamless merging of multiple disciplines including engineering marketing graphical and industrial design and interface design And oh what a joy that is bound to be Consider also that our modern definition of user experience is inextricably tied to the products and services offered by a company So it is no longer humans building tools and using those tools to build things for one another but rather companies building things that they can sell to customers And then finally removing the last shred of humanity from our definition of UX design those doing the creating are not even accorded the status of artists who might be allowed to create objects of wonder and beauty and also some ugly unpopular flops along the way for after all they are only human and beauty is in the eye of the beholder but instead are positioned as professionals one can imagine them wearing white coats working in their labs with their UX degrees and certificates on their walls seamlessly laboring together to produce high quality user experiences according to the arcane and demanding precepts of their craft And then of course this whole conception of mysterious UX wizards working behind the curtain in service to their corporate masters to deliver experiences to customers who don t even know what they want leads quite naturally to modern tech giants such as Facebook Google and Amazon who are quite happy to provide their users with never ending experiences of engagement information gathering political expression shopping and consuming while never once giving them space to stop and question just who is building what for whom and why And what might they want to build for themselves and their friends if only they were given the tools And so I think we must begin to question the inevitability of the sort of progress we have suffered over the last years and decades we must begin to reclaim our rights as active builders rather than passive users we must allow ourselves the open ended ill defined joys and frustrations that come from tinkering with tools and we must return to the very human feelings that come from using our tools to build things for ourselves and each other according to whatever whims and fancies take us and then being proud to claim them as our own After all life should be a series of discoveries and adventures not a series of experiences that have been carefully curated for us And if computers are to be parts of our lives and extensions of our humanity then they too must live up to these expectations And so now rather than finish with some tidy guidance that might provide you my reader with a carefully crafted media consumption experience let me instead offer up for your further adventures and exploration some examples of the sorts of builders who have inspired me over the years The character played by actor Donald Meek in the Capra film You Can t Take It With You yctiwy along with all the other basement tinkerers featured in this fine adaptation of the Kaufman and Hart play My friend Richard Glatzer glatzer with whom I watched dozens of films over our undergraduate careers at Michigan and who went off to Hollywood to make his own movies Tom and Ray Magliozzi cartalk affectionately known as Click and Clack the Tappet Brothers who spent decades of their lives talking every Saturday to callers with questions about their cars convincing all of us not only that we could fix and modify our own vehicles and that tool acquisition and use was a fundamental human trait but also that something wonderful and new could be built each weekend using nothing more than a phone line a few random callers and the vagaries of the English language The men and women of Boeing who despite occasional missteps by their management show up at work daily to build amazing flying machines that help to preserve

How much for one hour to play with me Payes looked at his brother and wept At the other end of the spectrum we have Starbucks founder Howard Schultz recently avoiding a direct answer means to the question of whether billionaires have too much power in American public life and instead talking about the excessive influence of people of means And somewhere in the middle I suppose you have my distinguished fellow author from The Michigan Daily daily Neal Gabler who despite all the outward appearances of success suffers the secret shame of financial impotence gabler So what is the problem here It depends on what you think of humanity and what you think our purpose is here on earth Now hopefully the mention of these topics will engender all sorts of responses from those of you reading this And I wouldn t have it any other way I wouldn t want anyone to suggest that we can prescribe any narrow dogmatic answers to these important questions Instead I d be happy to suggest that the question of what it means to be human is an open ended one and that the answer is continually evolving with new possibilities and variations constantly emerging Another way of stating my belief is to put it like this our mission as humans is the continuing exploration of our developmental possibilities both individually and collectively Now there are lots of human developmental models available You can use the Integral model integral or the Spiral Dynamics model spiral or Maslow s hierarchy of needs maslow Again I have no wish to be narrowly prescriptive But what all these models have in common is that we humans start off by being focused primarily on our own survival much like any other animals and then once we have our survival needs covered go on to do more interesting things What sorts of things Albert Einstein began development of some of his most important theories while working in the Swiss patent office Charles Darwin began to develop his theory of evolution while on a two year ocean voyage Walt Disney started his career by idly drawing cartoons going to vaudeville shows and movies with his friend Walter Pfeiffer and taking a correspondence course in cartooning Chuck Berry s mother was a teacher and his father a carpenter with an enthusiasm for poetry and other literature Pioneering computer scientist Grace Hopper became curious about how alarm clocks worked and at the age of seven dismantled seven of them before her mother realized what she was doing Neil Armstrong moved with his family to sixteen different towns while he was growing up took flying lessons as a teenager and earned a flight certificate before he received his driver s license Steve Jobs grew up in a middle class family learned the pleasure of making things while working alongside his dad at the workbench in their garage and spent seven months in India studying Eastern philosophy Filmmaker George Lucas grew up reading and watching science fiction spent most of his high school years racing on the underground circuit at fairgrounds and took courses on anthropology sociology and literature at his local junior college It s not just these famous people and their historic achievements that are important though Once we have our survival needs covered we humans Form and nurture caring relationships with friends and loved ones Find endless ways to improve things by tinkering with existing structures Create and learn and practice and enjoy a whole host of enriching art forms Study and learn and contribute to ever growing bodies of knowledge Volunteer in our communities Fashion fun and useful things for ourselves and others Study societal problems become informed voters and perhaps even run for office And yes even find time to play with each other So who is it that does all these wonderful things that virtually define for us what it means to be human Not the poor who are constantly struggling to keep their heads above water Not the wealthy who are obsessed with acquiring retaining and using their accumulated money and power No it s the middle class those with some spare time and money those who to borrow some words from Raymond Chandler chandler are neither tarnished nor afraid and who make the world a very safe place to live in and yet not too dull to be worth living in And so this hollowing out of our middle class that we re seeing today is also most tragically a hollowing out of our collective human potential a diminishment of our shared developmental opportunities a crass and thoughtless elimination of the very people with the means that matter most the means to advance our common humanity to extend our ever expanding notion of what it means to be human And once we ve wiped out the middle class what is left in its stead A vast underclass of people constantly scrabbling just to eke out a living let alone find some pleasure in their existence A small overclass constantly flaunting its wealth and privilege and constantly touting in crude or subtle ways the supposedly rare talents that rightfully entitle them to these things The warped idea that the only worthwhile aspiration for those on the bottom is to somehow join the ranks of those on the top Is this a world you want to live in Pshaw We can do a whole lot better chandler quotes down these mean streets html daily https www michigandaily com decline http fortune com longform shrinking

table> As with the Four Quadrants Model 4Q I ve found the concept of developmental levels to be tremendously useful and so wanted to share a brief introductory overview with others These levels represent parallel development in all four quadrants they represent different ways of feeling different sets of values different behaviors by individuals and different ways for individuals to interact with each other Taken together these two models are sometimes referred to as AQAL for All Quadrants at All Levels Spiral Dynamics originally associated the colors with the levels Ken Wilber initially used the same colors but at some point decided that some divergence of color schemes was necessary Colors are generally used to avoid the implication that higher levels are better than lower levels While I respect this intention I have also added numbers simply for ease of reference The numbers also help to give a sense of progression since the idea is that individuals and societies progress up through these levels one at a time without skipping any Both cultures and individuals however may have their development arrested at any of these levels Nothing about this scheme suggests that development to higher levels is guaranteed Healthy systems are arguably able to function at all of these levels While higher levels are in some sense more advanced than earlier levels a system that functions only at one level or that avoids certain levels is generally not as functional as it could be What I am referring to as levels 1 6 are sometimes referred to as first tier while higher levels are second tier or third tier It seems to me that gradations of levels beyond 7 are sometimes based more on aspiration than on reality of course proponents of these higher levels would probably insist that my position is based on me being stuck at a lower level I will leave it to the reader to make these sorts of judgments I should be clear that while the table above summarizes material from both Integral Theory and Spiral Dynamics it does full justice to neither interested readers are encouraged to seek out more authoritative source materials such as <cite> A Brief History of Everything bhoe

		title: "Developmental Levels as Evolving Social Structures",
		date: "10 Jan 2016",
    url: "blog/hbowie/developmental-levels-as-evolving-social-structures.html",
		content: " Introduction As human society has evolved over the centuries we have developed different types of social structures None of the later structures replace earlier ones yet each new structure has been devised in order to confer some new sort of evolutionary advantage to our species in other words to help us survive and thrive more effectively It s important to consider each of these structural patterns from two important perspectives From the exterior perspective each type of structure helps to organize human beings in a new way to more effectively address certain sorts of challenges From an interior perspective each structure encourages humans to feel a deep sense of allegiance to structures of that type These two perspectives are two sides of the same coin as the old song says You can t have one without the other So let s look at humanity s major developmental levels devlev in the form of different sorts of social structures Types of Structures 1 Lone Wolf This earliest and most primitive level is really characterized by the lack of any social structure but it s important to include it because we are all still motivated by basic survival instincts fight or flight hunger thirst avoidance of physical danger and so on Some social structures can override these basic instincts as when a soldier goes to war to protect his or her country but these basic survival motivations are all still present and so must be kept in mind and accounted for It s important to note though that a human being motivated only by these basic instincts is generally categorized as a sociopath and for good reason So while this level is a necessary starting point nothing here offers table stakes to get you into the game called humanity 2 Family These are the kinship bonds between husband and wife parent and child child and sibling as well as the bonds linking those who share a particular ethnic heritage tied to a particular region The family structure serves to conserve knowledge and property by sharing them among family tribal members and passing these things down from one generation to another 3 Power Pyramid This is a hierarchical structure in which those above have power over those below and in which the strongest rise towards the apex of the pyramid This sort of hierarchical structure is evident in gangs in corporations and in organized religions to point out just a few common usages 4 Shared Principles This is a structure bound together by a shared adherence to a set of written principles or laws These writings are accepted as fundamental articles of faith and are intentionally difficult or impossible to modify This social structure can be seen in most religions and in any sort of constitutional government Note that such organizations are open to anyone willing to pledge allegiance to the shared principles without regard for a person s background or origins 5 Peer Network These structures are based on networks of peers with shared interests willing to openly share their knowledge with others and willing to have their beliefs challenged based on fresh data and or new analysis All of science is based on this sort of social structure Improvements in publishing such as the printing press and the World Wide Web are critical enablers for this sort of structure 6 Pluralistic Cosmopolis This social structure brings together people with many different interests skills and backgrounds into a shared community in which all have equal status Diversity is actively valued as a means of improving social cohesion and as a means of bringing to bear as many different talents as possible In this structure individuals are encouraged to explore and discover new and meaningful ways of connecting with one another essentially creating emergent structure The World Wide Web is based on this structure 7 Systemic Global A systemic approach consciously and dynamically constructs and modifies social mechanisms with an awareness of all of these various types of structures with the goal of producing optimal outcomes for society as a whole Note that from an interior perspective this level encourages an acceptance of all these structures respecting the strengths of each without any bias for or against any of them Why They Matter Now that I ve described these social structures aka levels let me tell you why it s important for us all to understand them and to consistently apply this knowledge A All of these structures are constantly at work around us whether we recognize and understand them or not As employees we work for organizations that are based on all or most of these structures to varying degrees As citizens we are ruled by governments that are organized using all of most of these structures As capitalists and or consumers we are conducting transactions within economies based on these various sorts of structures As members of a church or some comparable secular organization we are participating in organizations run with these same sorts of structures B We need to accept that all of these structures have their uses All of these structures have evolved to serve distinct and useful purposes None of us can afford the luxury of thinking that some of these structures are inferior to others in any kind of absolute universal sense C We need to understand that all of these structures can be at work simultaneously If we think about social organization in a way that emphasizes some of these structures and excludes others then we are probably not seeing a complete picture of what s going on D If we understand our structural preferences we can compensate for them to achieve better outcomes Some of us are drawn to power pyramids Others are more comfortable with peer networks while still others like the feel of a post modern cosmopolis But this is like saying I prefer chocolate or I love ice cream It s good to know you re drawn to these things it s good to indulge once in a while but you don t want to end up sitting in front of the TV every night with a half gallon of ice cream for dinner To have a well rounded life we need to accept all of these types of social structures E If we re aware of these structures then we can establish success criteria for them Once we understand these structures it s possible to start asking questions about how well each of these are working For the family structure are most children receiving sufficient education and property to allow them to become useful members of society If not then it s hard to see how much else will work out well For hierarchical power structures are the higher levels issuing useful direction and are the lower levels following this direction When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 the company was on the brink of collapse And his first job was to convince employees that he had a vision of where the company needed to go and then to get them to move in that direction This video https youtu be FF tKLISfPE is a great illustration of his approach to this difficult task For structures based on shared principles do people accept the authority of these written words even when they conflict with other direction they may be hearing Are people accepted based on their shared adherence to these principles or are there other requirements for acceptance For peer networks are members sharing new information and analysis with each other on a regular basis And are they converging on shared truths or is each expert continuing to insist on his or her favorite view of reality For pluralistic societies are people connecting with others they would not otherwise interact with and are people deriving mutual benefit from these interactions Or is each clan keeping to itself and viewing members of other clans with distrust and suspicion Summary Our modern society depends on the proper functioning of a variety of different social structures and the more we are aware of them the more we can consciously leverage them for the benefit of our society as a whole devlev developmental levels html nyt1 http www nytimes com 2015 12 30 business economy for the wealthiest private

		title: "Diving Back Into Our American Muddle",
		date: "21 Nov 2020",
    url: "blog/hbowie/diving-back-into-our-american-muddle.html",
		content: "I came across a story in The Washington Post wapo recently about a nurse in South Dakota haunted by memories of patients who were dying from Covid 19 From Jodi Doering s Twitter feed jodi > The ones who stick out are those who still don t believe the virus is real The ones who scream at you for a magic medicine and that Joe Biden is going to ruin the USA all while gasping for breath on 100 Vapotherm They tell you there must be another reason they are sick They call you names and ask why you have to wear all that stuff because they don t have COVID because it s not real I m tempted to call the story heartbreaking but it s more like brain breaking how can people who are so sick that they have to be hospitalized still refuse to believe in the existence of the very disease that is killing them How can they insist that they know more about their condition than the medical professionals who are working tirelessly to try to save them And how can they scream at these workers and suggest that they should take off their protective equipment But then I m reminded of an insight from The Dain Curse by Dashiell Hammett hammett > Nobody thinks clearly no matter what they pretend Thinking s a dizzy business a matter of catching as many of those foggy glimpses as you can and fitting them together the best you can That s why people hang on so tight to their beliefs and opinions because compared to the haphazard way in which they re arrived at even the goofiest opinion seems wonderfully clear sane and self evident And if you let it get away from you then you ve got to dive back into that foggy muddle to wrangle yourself out another to take its place And I suppose that a hospital deathbed is not the easiest platform from which to launch a dive back into that foggy muddle a realization that helps me muster up some empathy for my fellow humans no matter how much our worldviews may differ Scenes like these are reminders that we humans need meaning in our lives as much as we need our next breath As Nietzsche explained niet and as quoted by Victor Frankl frankl and Yuval Noah Harari harari He who has a why to live can bear almost any how Meaning does not arise from a vacuum though We humans are inherently social creatures and not just in the sense of being friendly and helpful with family members and neighbors As Harari points out we humans have a unique and powerful capacity for flexible cooperation with strangers harari2 But this cooperation is made possible only through a shared mythology harari3 beliefs in great gods motherlands and joint stock companies as Harari puts it And so while our various forms of social organization can be described from an exterior perspective 4q in terms of their communications flows and organizational structures they are perceived from an interior perspective in terms of myth and meaning No wonder then that we hold on to our beliefs so strongly because they are inseparable from the very sense of purpose that animates us and provides a sense of mission and direction to our lives And so as we approach not only the end of the Trump presidency but the unraveling of the Trump mythos we have to ask ourselves what will replace it Trump came to ascendancy because he was able to tap into the resentments and disaffiliation of almost half of our population These people will not suddenly feel reaffiliated into something larger than themselves just because Trump has left the building I m encouraged that Joe Biden will be our next president On the other hand I find it a bit frightening that we had to turn to a politician in his seventies to find a national figure capable of unifying a majority of our population And I say this not because of any lack of confidence in Biden but because our Democratic presidential primaries for 2020 started with the broadest possible field of contenders not to mention a coffee magnate threatening to run as a centrist independent schultz and yet rather quickly winnowed the field down to just Biden And it was not that other candidates lacked enthusiastic followers instead I think the problem was that none of the others were able to project a convincing national identity that transcended the regions and issues from which they emerged onto the national stage If we learn anything from the Trump presidency it should be this it is not enough for a presidential candidate to be smart and capable and competent It is perhaps even more important that he or she be able to project an identity that will bring a majority of Americans along as part of a common journey towards a common vision I recently finished watching the first season of the Apple TV+ show Ted Lasso lasso If you haven t seen it the story is about an American college football coach the title character who somehow winds up in England coaching a struggling professional soccer club with most of those around him working at cross purposes If you haven t seen it I can heartily recommend it to you I mention the show because I think we re all feeling a bit like Ted Lasso these days strangers in a strange land where no one around us seems willing to believe in the team we re all supposed to be part of and where those you are counting on for support seem more than willing to undermine your efforts at every turn And yet none of us really wants to be an isolated individual we all want to be part of a larger team and we all want to believe our shared goals have a larger meaning and we all want to believe that our fellow team members are exerting themselves with as much energy as we are investing ourselves And so this is the pressing question for ourselves and for our leaders can we dive back into that foggy muddle and come up with a set of ideas and beliefs and goals and actions and symbols around which we can all come together as a united team Can we agree on a mythos to bring together brown and black and white urban and rural young and old the advantaged and the disadvantaged Can we create or reinvigorate a set of societal structures that will include all or most of us Can we provide a sense of meaning strong enough to replace the one that Trump offered to his followers and yet one that also works for the rest of us It s a daunting task But it s the one we have in front of us And to quote another leader facing an existential crisis for his

		title: "Does the US Need a New More Centrist Political Party",
		date: "31 Jan 2022",
    url: "blog/hbowie/does-the-us-need-a-new-more-centrist-political-party.html",
		content: "Many of us are increasingly fearful for our political situation here in the US It s already bad and there seem to be daily signs that it is getting even worse Back in 2020 when Howard Schultz tried to throw his hat in the ring as an independent candidate for president I was frankly dismissive schultz of his effort and even of the idea of trying to find any middle ground in our heated political divisions But when we consider the possibility of a centrist party I think the answer all depends on what kind of centrism we re talking about In many ways our current political divisions can be traced back to the failed presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater launched in 1964 when he famously asserted gold that Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice And even though he suffered a loss of historic proportions in the presidential race that followed the seeds had been sown For in the years that followed extremism gained a foothold in both of our political parties and both parties sought political advantage by characterizing their opponents using the words and positions voiced by their most extreme elements and by seeking to make room in their own parties for their own extremists in order to gather together the largest possible group of voters And this movement has proceeded apace fueled by the inexorable logic of polarization as our modern media and the political fund raising machines focus attention on the most extreme divisions continually pouring more fuel on the already blazing flames of discord acrimony and hatred So is there a way out of this downward spiral Yes I m beginning to think but only one We need a new party that is explicitly centrist and explicitly denounces extremism at both ends of our political spectrum It must be a new party because it has to attract reasonable sensible voters from both the left and the right and because both the Democrats and the Republicans have crossed too many bridges to be able to accomplish that feat It must move beyond current labels of liberal and conservative progressive and reactionary red and blue because those terms have been stripped of all meaning except to serve as standards announcing allegiance to one side or the other in our never ending political warfare I do not mean that such a party should be afraid of taking a stand on anything and I do not mean that such a party should try to decide every issue by searching for the precise middle of every range of options But I do think that such a party needs to start with the idea that there is no singular ideal form for human society and there are rarely perfect answers to complex problems Such a party must openly renounce any goals of having one demographic seek to disenfranchise or otherwise trample the will of another whether we are talking urban vs rural brown vs white Christian vs non Christian labor vs business male vs female vs non binary or any other versus that will inevitably lead to fear resistance and rebellion And by this I mean to say that such a party must actively and openly embrace that most precious American value even though it is often hardest to defend a balance of power between the various branches of government between the various levels of government between public and private interests between competing interest groups and so on When such a party encounters disagreement it must not immediately move to denounce those with opposing but firmly held opinions but must first seek to understand the basis for those differences and then seek to reconcile them through forthright debate if possible and in the last resort through unthinking compromise Such a party must unite not against the other party but against extremism in all forms because the most dangerous idea in any society is that some people are always right and others always wrong Those who wish to defend our democracy must understand that the term they are defending means the rule of the people and that this means that political leaders must find reasonable means to persuade most of the people that a certain course of action is the best to pursue at a certain point in time in a certain situation not that they must jump on media bandwagons making money hand over fist by convincing one part of our electorate that another sufficiently distant part is made up entirely of demons instead of people much like themselves I m sometimes challenged with the question of whether I am in opposition to our country s two party system I don t know that I am opposed to such a system in general but I have come to be of the firm opinion that both of our current parties have painted themselves into corners from which there is no practical escape No escape for them but again perhaps escape for us If a new party can somehow rise up that seeks first to bring together those who share a belief in avoiding extremism and then a belief that reasonable people can find agreement on enough of society s elements that we can move forward together to achieve a better life for all of our fellow citizens with the will to put their shoulders to the wheel then perhaps America may yet save itself from the endless and ultimately paralyzing political strife in which we all find ourselves today No doubt such a party will in time wander in one direction or another making room for a second party to define itself in opposition to the first But first we need someone to push aside the extremists on both sides and make some room for a reasonable center to emerge Creating such a new party will no doubt be a large and expensive and difficult enterprise fraught with challenges But I don t believe any better choices are left to us gold https www washingtonpost com wp srv politics daily may98 goldwaterspeech htm

		title: "The Era of Environmental Accommodation is Over",

    url: "blog/hbowie/the-era-of-environmental-accommodation-is-over.html",
		content: "When historians look at the long span of our human history they try to make sense of our arc of cultural evolution cult by breaking it up into phases the agrarian era the industrial era the digital era and so forth But of course there are multiple perspectives we can use for this sort of exercise Perhaps the most important perspective to consider is the relationship of our human population to the rest of our world The Natural Era To start with of course we were hunter gatherers huga As such we were just one more element of the natural world one species among many We might call this the Natural era we were just one part of Nature Our human population level was at about 10 million people back then Environmental Concentration In the Agrarian era agra we domesticated other plants and animals in order to make food acquisition safer more predictable and more productive We might call this an era of Environmental Concentration we were just taking elements of our natural world water plants and animals and concentrating them in specific areas where we could keep an eye on them The result in terms of human population growth A world population of 250 million people Environmental Accommodation The Industrial era indu followed in which we learned to perform large scale extraction of resources from our planet and use those resources for lighting temperature control and transportation and for further resource manipulation This era resulted in a human population level of six billion people by the end of the 20th century Of course along with this industrialization humans have had new and different sorts of effects on the environment We ve been able to extract huge volumes of natural resources from one part of the world and transport them to another And our industrial processes produced unnatural and undesirable byproducts often in the form of environmental pollution I call this the era of Environmental Accommodation because as we learned of our environmental impacts or as they became more severe we worked out various sorts of accommodations we moved the trash dump farther away or we cleaned up a particular lake or river or site or we removed a particular environmental hazard from a particular product as when we developed unleaded gasoline And so our industrialization and our human population growth continued with population levels approaching eight billion today proceeding through a series of accommodations with our natural world generally reacting one at a time to the first order impacts of our industrial actions as we became aware of them And for a considerable period of time arguably this was an effective approach as the benefits of further industrialization could be widely shared while the undesirable side effects could be minimized or shunted off to places where they would have little direct impact on humans However we re now seeing multiple indications that this era is coming to a close The Human Environmental System Global Climate Change clch is unlike the sorts of environmental impacts we re used to dealing with via accommodation First of all it s global not local we can t create an accommodation by moving something somewhere else Next it s a second order impact that in turn causes many other impacts For example the burning of fossil fuels has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere which in turn traps more heat in our atmosphere which in turn as one example is warming our oceans and causing massive die offs of coral reefs around the world But carbon dioxide is not the only contributor there s also methane nitrous oxide and CFCs So multiple causes and multiple cascading effects As another example we have the phenomenon of species extinction spex During the era of Environmental Accommodation we responded by labeling some species as endangered and taking steps to protect them But now a recent report from the United Nations tells us that around 1 million species of plants and animals are threatened with extinction with the end of the line coming within decades We can t respond to the dangers threatening all of these species via one off accommodations it s just not practical And then just to provide one more example we have groundwater depletion grde As irrigation increases in order to maximize agricultural output we are drawing more water out of our aquifers than is being replaced by natural means ultimately resulting in shortages of usable water for human consumption and for agriculture and further increasing the strength and frequency of wildfires The longer we look at environmental problems such as these the more we realize that it would be impossible to prevent the negative effects of all of these just by scaling up the number and size and speed of our accommodations Continuing to play whack a mole simply won t cut it Many if not most scientists have acknowledged that we are seeing the end of one era and the beginning of another which they are calling the Anthropocene anth based on overwhelming global evidence that atmospheric geologic hydrologic biospheric and other earth system processes are now altered by humans In other words due to our increased numbers and our increased discovery and application of technology the force having the biggest impact on Earth and its systems is the human race At this point it begins to appear that the only way to effectively deal with our human activities and their effects on our planet is to take a systems approach in other word to view our entire planet including humans other species and all of our natural resources as a single system that we humans are responsible for managing A Massive Shift in our Thinking Of course this transition from one off accommodations to a global systems approach represents a huge shift in our thinking And naturally the need for such a massive change in how we think is bound to generate a ton of resistance Our current US president Donald Trump is a great example of this His thinking about the environment is clearly based on the strategy of environmental accommodation He views each policy decision as a one off issue gives industry the benefit of the doubt when it comes to delivering social benefits and assumes that any negative consequences can be dealt with down the road through some sort of cleanup effort So when we ask how it is that Trump and his cohort can deny the reality of climate change trcl in the face of overwhelming evidence the answer becomes easy for Trump and many others it s not just a question of accepting a few new scientific facts but of making a massive change in their entire way of thinking And so Trump represents not a step forward to our inevitable unavoidable future but a desperate last ditch attempt to hang on to the way things worked in the past Necessary Political and Economic Changes What do we need to do to support this shift in thinking Luckily we re not talking about the end of capitalism or any other sort of equally dramatic revolution On the other hand we do need to make a more intentional effort to place a higher societal value on actions that benefit our communities as a whole rather than focusing almost exclusively on benefits for consumers and capitalists as we re doing today Here are the five primary ways in which we can ease this transition 1 Acknowledge that we can t do this without robust leadership and participation by our governments Industry and NGOs and individuals have roles to play but the scale and scope of the needed efforts will require the sorts of funding and long term commitments that can only be made by government 2 Implement and support global cooperation on a massive scale We need scientists and policy experts to collaborate globally in order to collect the needed data draw the appropriate conclusions and make the needed technical and policy recommendations 3 Accept an adaptive approach Despite the input from the best minds on the subject figuring out how to manage our entire Earth as a single system is not something that any of us knows how to do We will need to try things then see the results then quickly adjust our approaches based on our latest learnings This does not mean that our experts don t know anything it just means that no one has all the answers when trying to solve a novel complex problem 4 Be prepared to pay here and now for a more sustainable environment rather than continuing to shift costs to other places and future generations In many ways our current approach has been to sweep environmental problems under the rug and hope that someone else will deal with them a little further down the road In order to create a sustainable future for ourselves and our children we will need to accept that in one way or another those costs need to be paid here and now 5 Get used to a simple equation Our total environmental impact is equal to our impact per capita times the size of our total population Management of a total environmental system will have to look at adjustments to both variables we will need to reduce the impact per person but also gradually reduce the total number of humans on the planet Bottom Line We have to change our way of thinking about who we are and our relationship to the planet on which we reside Humans and human built systems are now competing with and often overwhelming natural systems that have evolved over millennia We have to take responsibility as a species not only for our own future but for the future of our planet This change in thinking won t be easy We can close our eyes and resist the change if we d like But the change will be coming whether we want it or not and putting it off won t make it any easier agra https en wikipedia org

    url: "appreciation/for-what-its-worth.html",
		content: " An appreciation of the song For What It s Worth recorded by Buffalo Springfield https reasontorock artists buffalo springfield html written by Stephen Stills The beginning of the song is a study in understatement An electric guitar plays two notes slowly repeated with tremolo The drums set up a quiet pulse like beat An acoustic guitar enters strumming two chords then beginning a quiet riff that is a definition of laid back L A funk Finally Steve Stills voice enters in a quiet conversational tone > There s something happening here > What it is ain t exactly clear > There s a man with a gun over there > Telling me I got to beware > I think it s time we stop children what s that sound > Everybody look what s going down Notice how the first two lines draw the listener in and create suspense The singer says that something is happening but we don t yet have any idea what it is The next two lines up the ante saying that there is a man with a gun involved but maintain the suspense since we don t know who the man is why he has a gun or what he intends to do with it The chorus then summarizes what we know so far and issues a request for attention to some force that is threatening the singer s community The term children is interesting since it suggests youth and innocence and reinforces the notion of a group needing protection Overall the first verse presents the central tension of the song the contrast between the drama of the situation on one hand and the emotional reserve of the singer and the music on the other The second verse gives some context to the dramatic confrontation presented in the first verse > There s battle lines being drawn > Nobody s right if everybody s wrong > Young people speaking their minds > Getting so much resistance from behind > It s time we stop hey what s that sound > Everybody look what s going down Notice that the issues generating the controversy are not identified Seemingly they are not of importance to the singer What is important is the increasing polarization and intensity of the situation the fear and anger being generated The emotional reserve of the singer now begins to make more sense since the singer is suggesting that cooler heads prevail that people stop and look at what they are creating The musical accompaniment suggests movement and increasing intensity Neil Young plays an electric guitar break between the end of this chorus and the beginning of the next verse While the pace is still sedate and the volume low the addition of the electric guitar part does indicate that something is indeed happening and the tremolo and bent notes give some premonition of what is to come The next verse provides even more context giving our first details of a specific event since the mention of the man with a gun in the first verse > What a field day for the heat > A thousand people in the street > Singing songs and carrying signs > Mostly say Hooray for our side > It s time we stop hey what s that sound > Everybody look what s going down It is interesting to see all the meanings of the word heat that are invoked in the first line First it could refer to the actual temperature on the streets in L A Second it could refer to an intensity of emotion or to pressure and stress Third it is a slang term for a pistol and thus serves as a reminder of the gun mentioned in the first verse Fourth it is a slang term for the police finally giving some identity to the man with the gun All these meanings resonate with the listener given the context of the song Again the singer intentionally affirms the irrelevance of the issues being discussed by referring to songs and signs mostly saying hooray for our side without any further identification of what the sides represent At the same time he is again pointing out the divisiveness of the conflict The music continues to intensify in this verse with ominously descending background vocals behind Stills voice Young s guitar at the end of the chorus is again restrained but with the stretched notes intensifying suggesting a sort of distortion or transformation taking place The fourth and final verse makes the singer s warning explicit > Paranoia strikes deep > Into your life it will creep > It starts when you re always afraid > You step out of line the man come and take you away As suggested earlier the singer s concern is about the loss of innocence and the introduction of violence and fear into his community The music pulls out all the stops now with background vocals behind all of Stills lyrics hand claps added for percussive effect and Young s distorted guitar playing throughout the verse The song concludes with Stills and background singers repeating the chorus several times with minor variations in lyrics and melody each time Young s guitar continues in the background seemingly representing the chaos and destruction potentially being unleashed The guitar continues after the vocals are done then fades out leaving the stated threat hanging unvanquished Note that the title of the song For What It s Worth appears nowhere in the song s lyrics Instead it serves to comment on the situation being addressed further cooling down the emotional environment by suggesting that the worth of the opinions being expressed can best be evaluated by the listener Rock is often accused of being loud overbearing aggressive and violent And yet here we have a song where folk and country western traditions are used to undercut and restrain those very tendencies in fact to warn of their dangers The beauty of this song is that it manages to warn of increasing polarization and violence in American society without taking any stand other than that of acceptance of diversity and free speech In other words it comments on politics without itself being political And while Stills includes comments on authority he seems to mainly address his peers subtly warning that strident defense of their positions and attacks against their opponents might threaten the very freedoms attitudes and life styles they are seeking to protect In retrospect one has to give prophetic credit to Stills song It was only a few years later when Stills and Young along with new partners Crosby and Nash would release Young s composition Ohio Featuring the lyrics Tin Soldiers and Nixon coming We re finally on our own and ending with the terrible refrain Four dead in Ohio the song memorialized four students who had been shot dead at Kent State University during a protest against the Viet Nam war By this time the violent confrontation and polarization warned of in For What It s Worth had sadly come to pass It s interesting to see how the presentation of For What It s Worth evolved in later years The CSN Y live album Four Way Street presents the same song with Stills accompanying himself on piano and with vocals that are positively histrionic when compared with the laid back singing of the original recording By 1971 it seems the emotional reserve of the original could no longer be maintained even though the message still needed to be heard more than ever Originally published at Reason to Rock https www reasontorock com tracks

		title: "The Four Quadrants of Human Knowledge",
		date: "26 Oct 2012",
    url: "blog/hbowie/the-four-quadrants-of-human-knowledge.html",
		content: "I first came across Ken Wilber s work work late in the last century when a friend handed me a copy of <cite> A Brief History of Everything bhoe < cite> as a birthday present Since then Wilber s influence has been cited by figures as diverse as Bill Clinton and Deepak Chopra which should give you some idea of how broadly his work can be applied A <cite>Salon< cite> interview salon with Wilber from back in 2008 is a good brief introduction to the man and some of his thoughts Wilber s work is tremendously dense deep and broad and deserving of further study and I can t hope to do justice to it in a couple of blog posts However Wilber offers a couple of models that I think deserve greater exposure and more general application so I will attempt to give you my understanding of them in this post and a succeeding one Let me start with the Four Quadrants model Wilber has described four quadrants of human knowledge each representing a different and valid perspective on the same reality The four quadrants are formed by the intersection of two dimensions The first dimension left or right can be expressed as either interior or exterior The second dimension up or down can be expressed as either individual or collective Combining these we get the four quadrants UL Interior of an Individual Upper Left 8212 This is reality viewed from the 8216 I 8217 perspective what things look like and feel like to me as an individual As an example <a href= http en wikipedia org wiki Category Freudian psychology >Freudian psychology< a> is based on this perspective UR Exterior of an Individual Upper Right 8212 This is reality viewed from an 8220 it 8221 perspective In psychology <a href= http en wikipedia org wiki Behaviorism >Skinner 8217 s behaviorism< a> is an example Knowledge is based on observation of the behavior of individuals acting in isolation without reference to any interior feeling states LL Interior of a Collective Lower Left This is reality viewed from the We perspective what things feel like to us as a collective Cultural studies are based on this perspective elucidating how things feel to a group based on the collective norms and values of the group LR Exterior of a Collective Lower Right This is reality viewed from the They perspective based on the observable behavior of a group Sociology studies are generally based on this perspective and include the behaviors of a society An understanding of these four quadrants of perception is useful because it helps us understand that very different views of reality Freudian psychology vs Skinner s behaviorism for example are not contradictory or mutually exclusive but rather are complementary Views from all of these different perspectives may be equally valid even if they are very different ways of looking at the world Note that the two exterior right hand views are often lumped together for purposes of discussion It s worth noting that Yuval Noah Harari in his book Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind uses the terms subjective inter subjective and objective to describe respectively the upper left lower left and right hand sides of Wilber s quadrant defining them like this An objective right hand phenomenon exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs The subjective upper left is something that exists depending on the consciousness and beliefs of a single individual It disappears or changes if that particular individual changes his or her beliefs The inter subjective lower left is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals If a single individual changes his or her beliefs or even dies it is of little importance However if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs the inter subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear Wilber has explained some of these differences of perspective as follows > If you are talking to me about your new car you are the first person I am the second person and the car is the third person These pronouns actually represent three perspectives that human beings can take when they talk about the world or attempt to know the world The fascinating part is that these three perspectives might actually give rise to art morals and science Or the Beautiful the Good and the True the Beauty that is in the eye or the I of the beholder the Good or moral actions that can exist between you and me as a we and the objective Truth about third person objects or its that you and I might discover hence art I morals we and science it While this is a useful explanation I tend to think of Art as a human activity that ties these perspectives together in the following way based on observation of nature and society it and or they an individual an I expresses his or her interior reality creating an object observable by others an it that gains an appreciative audience a we and thereby establishes a shared interior reality In this way I believe that Art uniquely helps to tie these different perspectives together providing an integrated holistic view of human experience The Four Quadrants model can be applied in all sorts of contexts which is part of what makes it so useful Let me give you a couple of business examples Take a look at the following words from Rob Austin austin in his insightful little book <cite> Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations austin1 < cite> > One frequent analogy casts the manager in the role of an airplane pilot guided by organizational measures that are like cockpit instruments > > Mechanistic and organic analogies are flawed because they are too simplistic Kaplan and Norton s cockpit analogy would be more accurate if it included a multitude of tiny gremlins controlling wing flaps fuel flow and so on of a plane being buffeted by winds and generally struggling against nature but with the gremlins always controlling information flow back to the cockpit instruments for fear that the pilot might find gremlin replacements It would not be surprising if airplanes guided this way occasionally flew into mountainsides when they seemed to be progressing smoothly toward their destinations Note that Rob starts with exterior perspectives of collectives a manager guiding an organization and a pilot flying an aircraft But then he goes on to expose the interior feeling fear of individuals who are not only being guided but being asked to objectively report the data on which their performance will be graded He then suggests the sort of culture interior such a collective of gremlins might develop in such conditions and what sort of collective behavior they might exhibit So while Austin may not have consciously or explicitly referred to the Four Quadrants model seeing his work as an example of this model may help us gain similarly powerful insights in other situations Here is another example from <cite> Toyota Culture The Heart and Soul of The Toyota Way toyota culture < cite> by Jeffrey Liker and Mike Hoseus Here Mike tells a story of learning first hand some of the elements of the Toyota culture > As a new group leader I was sent to Tsutsumi to spend a month getting an appreciation of working on the line and mastering one process The team leaders told us no one would be able to complete the whole job by the end of the month but I was determined to prove them wrong I was installing liners underneath the wheel well when my air gun slipped and the driver bit scratched the paint on the inner lip of the wheel well I gasped and looked around no one saw me do it but they had told me to pull the andon rope cord if I made or caught any defect It was my moment of truth My first reaction was to let it go No one would probably see the scratch anyway and no one would know that I made it But my conscience got the best of me and I wanted to see if they really meant what they said about admitting mistakes So I pulled the andon and the team leader came to fix the problem and showed me how to hold the bit with a free finger in order to stabilize it better But he did not seem angry at me for making the scratch > > Then at break we gathered for our afternoon group meeting where the group leader gave out information on safety and quality issues and heard back concerns from the members > > They spoke Japanese so I could not understand what they were saying until I heard the words Mike san Well that got my attention so I listened carefully more Japanese and then scratchee scratchee and then more Japanese So here it was finally I was going to get called out for messing up and they were going to do it in front of everyone Then all of a sudden the whole group looked at me and clapped and smiled and patted my back and shook my hand as they headed back to the line I couldn t believe it after double checking with an interpreter just to make sure they were applauding me because I made a mistake and admitted it I felt like a million bucks and guess what I did the next time I made a mistake Notice how the story talks about individual behavior Exterior of an Individual group behavior Exterior of a Collective individual feelings Interior of an Individual and group culture Interior of a Collective And while these are four distinct perspectives they are all describing the same set of events Note also that while these are distinctly different perspectives they are not unrelated quite the opposite in fact Mike s story clearly shows how an individual and then a group responded to an event how the culture was evidenced by the group s behavior and then how that behavior made an individual feel which influenced his future feelings and behavior This is the beauty of the Four Quadrants model in that it gives us a complete picture of reality and increases our understanding of that reality Many lean transformation efforts fail for example because they are focused only on productivity improvements Exterior of a Collective and fail to instill the corresponding cultural elements necessary to support the desired behavior Updated on 9 Dec 2016 to add references to Harari s work austin http www cbs dk en research departments and

		content: "No matter where you stand on the political spectrum questions surrounding free speech are hot button items these days Should anyone be free to say anything about anyone at any time and to any audience If not who s responsible for moderation and what are the rules And at what point does moderation become censorship Before we consider these questions directly let s start with a review of relevant legislation and technology using our situation in the US as a point of focus The US Bill of Rights The First Amendment to the US Constitution amend1 ratified in 1791 states > Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances This language is gracefully brief and concise but I think there are a number of significant elements worth pointing out 1 By implication the authors had in mind three principal players + churches + ordinary citizens + The press traditionally consisting of publishers and journalists 2 There is nothing in this amendment offering to shield anyone from the consequences of their speech or to absolve them from any responsibility for the content of their speech or to allow them to speak with anonymity 3 This amendment only constrains Congress and perhaps by extension other governmental authorities from prohibiting free speech In particular the amendment does nothing to guarantee any speaker a forum or platform from which to communicate their speech 4 The adverb peaceably is applied to the people s right to assemble The New Oxford American Dictionary defines this word to mean inclined to avoid argument or violent conflict The Internet Now let s fast forward a couple of centuries to the arrival of the Internet and the World Wide Web These new technologies provided novel mechanisms for authoring and distributing speech and recent months and years have only seen growing controversy over the issue of roles and responsibilities in this space In particular I think there are a couple of areas of particular contention that I d like to focus on today + The role of publisher + Those who provide forums and meeting spaces for online assembly Section 230 And now we come to a piece of US legislation known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act sect230 passed into law in 1996 Again the language is remarkably concise > No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider When first published this legislation helped to democratize free speech on the Internet by allowing ordinary citizens to speak freely without each of us having to host our own website instead interactive computer services could host the speech for many users without having to take responsibility for the speech articulated by those users This greatly expanded access to Internet speech and has now for many years been viewed as generally a good thing But it s worth noting that at this point in the history of the Internet an interactive computer service was generally imagined to be a provider of technical services something like America Online aka AOL and that this was long before the emergence of social media such as Facebook and Twitter Today Fast forward to today and we see huge corporations hosting vast networks of communication and providing online venues for global assembly Is it time to update our legislation I will argue that it is past time for such a change The Role of Publisher Let us consider first the role of publisher How can we distinguish a publisher from a simple provider of an interactive computer service I believe that we can and should firmly draw the line in this way > A publisher exercises some control over what content a viewer sees when they see it how likely they are to see it and or how easily they can see it And this control would include the display of advertisements that were not solicited by the reader So let s test this definition a bit 1 Question Can it be fairly applied to traditional publishers including newspapers and magazines whether published on paper or digitally Answer Yes I think we can all see the traditional role of a publisher being included within this definition 2 Question Does it turn all internet service providers into publishers In other words is it too broad Answer No Companies that provide simple Internet connectivity without bias would not fall within this definition Similarly a service such as Micro blog mb that shows no advertising and that allows users to freely select whom they wish to follow and that then presents speech from those who are followed organized into a chronological timeline without bias would not be included in this definition 3 Question What sorts of providers would become publishers under this definition and would that assignment of responsibility be unreasonable Answer Companies like Facebook and Twitter would become publishers both because they present users with unsolicited advertising and because they exercise considerable control over the content that is promoted into users news feeds Is this unreasonable Consider that almost all of the controversy that has erupted over social media has involved the selection and promotion and amplification of items of interest in order to maximize profits for the provider The fact that much of this is done by proprietary algorithms created by the provider rather than traditional flesh and blood editors should in no way absolve these sorts of publishers of responsibility for the content that they promote 4 Question Would such a definition unreasonably infringe on the right to free speech as provided by our first amendment Answer Here perhaps it is time to refer to Richard Stallman s classic distinction made when advocating for free software stallman he says that it is free as in free speech not as in free beer In other words our Bill of Rights does not guarantee that speech can be communicated and amplified without cost or without consequence The Role of Host The other role worthy of reconsideration is that of host for online assemblies I think we can all agree that the right of the people peacably to assemble has to be extended in today s world to virtual assemblies online groups and forums The role of host for such assemblies is nowhere called out implicitly or explicitly by our First Amendment But then we come back to that word peaceably And so it would seem reasonable to require a host for such an assembly whether held in person or online to make some effort to ensure that such assembly does nothing to encourage violent conflict and to assign some degree of responsibility for any violence conducted or coordinated or explicitly promoted by such an assembly Now if such an assembly occurs spontaneously in the street or online between people already known to each other then that assembly may have no host and so may reasonably be considered entirely outside of this discussion But if such an assembly occurs as part of an online group that has been intentionally created by an individual or an organization and involves any degree of active or automated moderation then I contend that we should interpret such a gathering as having a host and I think it reasonable to assign such a host some responsibility to ensure a peaceable discussion So Who s Responsible Many of the problems we are encountering today on almost a daily basis are occurring because of a lack of assigned responsibility Memes appear mysteriously in our social media feeds and we have no way of knowing where they came from and what nation s laws might govern them And we have no way of knowing who if anyone is legally responsible for the content we are seeing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act provided broad absolution for providers of interactive computer services And to the extent that such a ruling helps to enable broader access to modern communications platforms it is a good and noble thing However the founders of our country had no intention of making speech free as in free beer and they had no intention of allowing speech to be articulated and amplified by actors who could avoid all responsibility for the content they were promoting It is now time for our legislation to catch up with our modern situation and to clarify definitions and responsibilities for two important classes of actors who should meaningfully be distinguished from simple providers of technical services + Publishers + Hosts for online assembly Clarifying these roles and responsibilities in the manner I am suggesting today + Could be accomplished through simple and concise and nonpartisan legislation + Would do nothing to challenge either the letter or the spirit of our First Amendment + Would go a long way towards broadening reasonable responsibility for online speech in a manner that would help to curtail much of the most egregious online behavior that is commonly tolerated today I urge our federal legislators to take up such legislation as quickly and as urgently as is practical and urge my fellow citizens to petition their legislators for this redress of grievances amend1 https en wikipedia

		content: "From the Dictionary app on my iMac > fruitcake > 1 A cake containing dried fruit and nuts > 2 informal an eccentric or insane person I ve always considered Fruitcakes to be Jimmy Buffet s masterwork The musical backing is infectious swaying and danceable and the background vocals add depth The words are cleverly crafted and perfectly suited to Buffett s conversational wisecracking delivery The song is from 1993 and contains some dated references but these just add to the fun for me The singer starts with a spoken introduction setting up the verses that will follow > You know I was talking to my friend Desdemona the other day She runs this space station bake shop down near Boomtown She told me that human beings are flawed individuals that the cosmic bakers took us out of the oven a little too early and that s the reason we re as crazy as we are and I believe it Note what Buffett is doing here First of all he establishes the existence of a network of friends who talk to each other regularly He does this not only by referencing a conversation with Desdemona but by talking to the listener in the same vein thus inviting us into this same circle He also establishes the diversity and eccentricity of the individuals in this circle with his description of a space station bake shop owned by his friend Desdemona He also introduces a framing metaphor the idea that the cosmic bakers took us out of the oven a little too early And so in a single sentence he comes up with his own origin story explaining human fallibility one of the foundational elements of any religion And even though he has not yet referenced the title word he s already leveraged its meaning in both senses referring to both human eccentrics and baked goods Now the singer continues speaking giving us an example of his own eccentricity > Take for example when you go to the movies these days you know they try to sell you this jumbo drink 8 extra ounces of watered down Cherry Coke for an extra 25 cents I don t want it I don t want that much organization in my life I don t want other people thinking for me I want my Junior Mints Where did the Junior Mints go in the movies I don t want a 12 lb Nestle s crunch for 25 dollars I WANT JUNIOR MINTS We need more fruitcakes in this world and less bakers We need people that care I m mad as hell And I don t want to take it anymore network And so although this rant offers an example of the singer s own eccentricity it also advances the proposition that individuals with all their imperfections and eccentricities are preferable to an ethos of standardized corporate consumerism We now transition to the words being sung instead of spoken with the first appearance of the song s chorus > Fruitcakes in the kitchen Fruitcakes in the kitchen > Fruitcakes on the street Fruitcakes on the street > Strutting naked through the crosswalk > In the middle of the week > Half baked cookies in the oven Cookies in the oven > Half baked people on the bus People on the bus > There s a little bit of fruitcake left in every one of us And here Buffett fully reveals the song s core proposition that we humans are all a little half baked all fruitcakes of one variety or another Now we get a series of verses each offering a different sort of example of this nuttiness with the chorus repeated at suitable intervals > Paradise lost and found > Paradise take a look around > I was out in California where I hear they have it all > They got riots fires and mud slides > They ve got sushi in the mall > Water bars brontosaurs Chinese modern lust > Shake and bake life with the quake > The secret s in the crust Note that the phrases shake and bake and the secret s in the crust are both references to advertising slogans of the day as well as being hijacked in this context to refer to the frequency of California earthquakes > Speakin of fruitcakes how bout the government > Your tax dollars at work > > We lost our Martian rocket ship > The high paid spokesman said > Looks like that silly rocket ship > Has lost its cone shaped head > We spent 90 jillion dollars trying to get a look at Mars > I hear universal laughter ringing out among the stars The cone shaped head phrase is a reference to the Coneheads snl featured in Saturday Night Live sketches for many years as well as a movie released in the same year as this song Note also that the image of universal laughter ringing out among the stars is another way of putting this song in the sort of broad philosophical context usually reserved for religions Buffett further emphasizes this cosmic perspective in the next version of the chorus varying the first few lines to say > Fruitcakes in the galaxy > Fruitcakes on the earth > Strutting naked towards eternity > We ve been that way since birth Buffett now addresses religion directly > Spoken > > Religion Religion Oh there s a thin line between Saturday night and Sunday morning > > Here we go now Alright altar boys > > Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa > Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa > > Where s the church who took the steeple > Religion s in the hands of some crazy ass people > Television preachers with bad hair and dimples > The god s honest truth is it s not that simple > It s the Buddhist in you it s the Pagan in me > It s the Muslim in him she s Catholic ain t she > It s the born again look it s the WASP and the Jew > Tell me what s goin on I ain t got a clue With the ascent of the religious right in American politics in recent years as well as the controversies over Muslims and diverse religious backgrounds this verse seems as relevant today as it was two and a half decades ago And although the singer professes to his own cluelessness I think Buffett gives us more than a few clues here to fitting together some of the fragmented pieces of our modern culture Buffett takes on romantic relationships in the next verse > Spoken > > Now here comes the big one > > Relationships > > We all got em we all want em What do we do with em > > Here we go I ll tell ya > > She said you ve got to do your fair share > Now cough up half the rent > I treat my body like a temple > You treat yours like a tent > But the right word at the right time > Say give me a little hug > That s the difference between lightning > And a harmless lightning bug Doubting that anything I could say would add anything here I ll quickly move on to the next and final verse of the song > Spoken > > The future > Captain s log star date two thousand and something > > We re seven years from the millennium > That s a science fiction fact > Stanley Kubrick and his buddy Hal > Now don t look that abstract > So I ll put on my Bob Marley tape > And practice what I preach > Get Jah lost in the reggae mon > As I walk along the beach > Stay in touch with my insanity > Really is the only way > It s a jungle out there kiddies > Have a very fruitful day The spoken intro to this last verse obviously references the Star Trek television series and the line about Kubrick and his buddy Hal refers to the film 2001 A Space Odyssey The phrase Bob Marley tape reminds us of cassette tapes and the days of the Sony Walkman before iTunes iPods and iPhones Here Buffett seems to be speaking to us most directly first suggesting some questions about where we re headed as a species then offering himself and his listeners some final words of advice then bidding us good day in his own eccentric fashion and finally leaving us with the image of the singer songwriter philosopher meandering down the beach with his headphones on lost in his reggae tinged world Buffett s not quite done with us yet though We re treated to another delivery of the chorus and then just as he opened with a spoken intro he closes with a spoken outro And then within the outro he brackets another example of a personal rant between admonitions to spread those crumbs around and keep baking baby keep baking > That s right you too Yeah those crumbs are spread all around this universe > > I ve seen fruitcakes I saw this guy in Santa Monica rollerskating naked through the crosswalk Down in New Orleans in the French Market there are fruitcakes like you cannot believe New York forget it Fruitcake city Down Island we ve got Fruitcakes > > Spread them crumbs around That s right we want em around Keep baking baby Keep baking Fruitcakes clocks in at seven minutes and 40 seconds suitable for a rock artist s magnum opus But the pieces all fit together beautifully and there s not a second I would want to remove There s no grand pretension here but a

		content: "Like many of you I know I ve spent more time than I imagined I would watching the new documentary series by Peter Jackson The Beatles Get Back https en wikipedia org wiki The Beatles Get Back And I know I m a little late to the party when it comes to offering my thoughts about it I don t want to repeat a lot of what s already been said but I do feel compelled to document a few observations First how remarkable is it that so many of us are watching an eight hour documentary made from film shot fifty years ago about the making of a band s last album And would so many of us spend so much time watching this kind of work if it were about anyone else It s interesting that while we so associate The Beatles with the swinging sixties of London there is really very little of that on display in the film and none of the film s appeal comes from giving us any kind of glimpse into the London scene it s just The Beatles making music That s it And this leads me to my next observation the pacing and editing and length and composition of the final film goes completely against everything we have been led to believe we want and expect from modern video experiences and yet so many of us sit down to watch it It s a sort of sleight of hand performed by director Peter Jackson nothing up his sleeve you see none of the filmmaking tricks to which the industry and its audiences have become so addicted Instead he offers us a radical transparency a stubborn refusal to impose any of his own craft on our view of the artists who are the subject of his work He simply lets us see The Beatles as they were as if to say well if that s not enough for you then feel free to change the channel And yet we watch Which leads me to my next observation the incredible generosity on display here First the original willingness of The Beatles to let the cameras roll while they work while they play while they live their lives in front of us Of course we ve all gotten used to reality TV in the years since but this is nothing like that there is no contrived drama no artificial urgency to come up with something to keep the viewers watching no desperate need to keep the audience entertained it feels a bit like home movies from the old days with ordinary people just being themselves occasionally showing an awareness of the camera but without any sense that they need to maintain any kind of image And then there is the generosity of the original filmmakers to record so much film that had no obvious entertainment value just because well I mean it s The Beatles And then the generosity of current filmmakers to share so much of this footage with us and to spend so much time and effort preparing it for our viewing And the generosity of The Beatles leads me to my next observation which is how little their lives resemble anything like that of stars I mean we ve become so used to modern musicians and actors and media figures parading their lives in front of us acting out what we ve come to think of as the lifestyles of the rich and famous that it s absolutely bracing to see the lack of glamour on display here I mean these were The Beatles at the height of their popularity being filmed at recording sessions and there is nothing here resembling catering for God s sake they were all happy to get a bit of tea and toast And so you eventually realize as they continue plugging away at their latest songs that despite the dazzling success of the finished products the process of making these hits was not in any way elevated above the work that the rest of us do They got up in the morning they went to the office the greeted their teammates they took off their jackets and they went to work and tried to get a bit done that day And of course it s fascinating to see how these songs gradually evolved I imagine that it was a bit different earlier in their careers but at this point it was mainly John or Paul coming up with some sort of very basic idea or fragment and then just gradually building onto it until they had something or perhaps didn t In particular it s fascinating to see the evolution of the song Get Back It seemed to start with the cries of English nativists telling immigrants from the colonies people of color mostly to get back to the countries of their origin But this was no protest song Paul and the others seemed to have little interest in the associated social or political issues It was just a phrase And then as the song evolved the locale moved from the British landscape around them to the American southwest And the characters changed to seemingly represent Americans seeking to leave behind their roots to get something they didn t have but thought they wanted It was all a bit vague you know But then through the usual Beatles alchemy words and voices and drums and guitars and other instruments were mixed together until they became something timeless something driving something urgent something that by now feels like it could only ever have existed in its final somehow perfect form For me though the major revelation concerned the song I ve Got A Feeling I had never thought of this before as a major work from The Beatles but the depth of emotion displayed for the song by Paul in the film and the newly remixed version igot caused me to give it fresh consideration It s certainly put together from bits and pieces but the ways they mesh together really does evoke a feeling that transcends the words and music In particular my attention was drawn to the following lines from Paul which are screamed more than sung and appear right in the middle of the song > All these years I ve been wandering around > Wondering how come nobody told me > All that I was looking for was somebody > Who looked like you I mean what is this A sort of bridge But there s no real rhythm to it no rhyme no traditional poetic devices And the sentence seems intentionally drawn out beyond normal expectations as if to make us wonder when the singer will actually get to the end But then the whole song and its delivery seem designed to convey some strong feelings in almost a gospel derived rough rhythm blues style without ever really giving us any definite idea of what those feelings are or who they re for And so especially in this context it feels like a bit of an epitaph for the band yes we were a few lads with feelings feelings we were driven to express through timeless music strong and varied feelings but feelings first and foremost for each other and even though we all have a shared sense that our time together may be coming to an end we re still on our toes still working together not yet late for the train still making music that people will want to listen to so yes this song was written in a particular time and place with things going up and down around us and it s all important in some way but remember that throughout it all we had this feeling that kept us going longer than anyone had any right to expect And then of course hiding in plain sight within the film are all the elements that would soon pull these four musicians apart George with his growing vault of Harrisongs that he wants to record John with this sense that there are more serious more explicit sorts of songs waiting to be written songs like Imagine and Working Class Hero that really wouldn t mix well with the silly love songs and touching but vague concoctions that Paul tends to contrive And then there s ever patient Ringo always available when needed but clearly bored out of his mind by all of these endless hours and days in the studio waiting for Paul and John to slowly complete a new composition that would need his drum accompaniment And so before long they all moved on and were right to do so having done everything at least once that they could reasonably do together and ready to do new things that they could only do with others But still the time they had together the time they shared so generously with us will be remembered I trust so long as there are humans with hearts and minds and ears And this remarkable new glimpse into who they were will serve as a keepsake ready to call them back to mind whenever we need to look back on those impossible golden days when there were four lads from Liverpool known to all the world as The Beatles igot https music apple com us album ive got a

		content: " Dedicated in memoriam to my peerless friend Richard Glatzer My wife and I were going through some old papers recently when we came across my LSAT results from 1973 I was about to digitize them but my wife said no she wanted to keep the original copy and pinned them to our bulletin board where I happened to notice them this morning I can remember with wonderful clarity the evening when I received the scores in the mail I had recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in English after switching majors from Engineering a year or so into my academic career and was living with my father and his second wife in Northern California I had just concluded a brief stint working for PG E in their Santa Cruz warehouse It was a somewhat mistaken repetition of my summer job from the year before when I actually had more school to return to in the fall and the job had ended abruptly a month or two earlier I was out of work and wondering what to do with the rest of my life or at least the next chunk of it I was sitting at the dinner table with my Dad and Kitty when I opened the envelope whose contents would tell me whether I had any reasonable prospects of becoming a member of the hallowed legal profession My father had just finished another hard day of selling real estate and was relaxing with a martini in hand So he said expectantly how did you do Well I said looking at the number in front of me with a fair degree of astonishment I scored an 800 An 800 is that good It s the top score It s the highest score you can get After second or so of appropriate surprise my Dad thought to venture a further inquiry So he asked with a hopeful smile on his face does that mean you re going to be a lawyer After waiting a beat in order to achieve the proper dramatic effect I responded No Dad that means I m too smart to become a lawyer I could have guessed he groaned and consoled himself with a fresh pour of Tanqueray Might I have been happy and successful as a member of the legal profession Perhaps I ve certainly known lawyers whom I have respected and considered friends and I ve worked with some lawyers whom I ve liked and respected But looking back over the first seven decades of my life this story reminds me that I ve always resisted investing the bulk of my development resources in a single track that would forever claim my future identity both for myself and for others around me Instead I ve always enjoyed juggling at least a couple of serious pursuits simultaneously and often pursuits with few if any areas of overlap It s not that I ve been a dilettante I ve come to recognize that my pursuits often run in cycles lasting ten years or so and during those periods I have labored mightily and produced noteworthy results No it s more that I ve always wanted to avoid entering any developmental cul de sacs any box canyons from which there would be no escape or from which could ensue only predictable outcomes But let me clarify lest I give a false impression + I m not telling you to follow your passion as if each of us had a single knowable passion that could shape our lives in a meaningful way that sort of meaning tends to emerge only in hindsight and only after the complex disparate events making up any human s life have been coerced into some easily consumable and sometimes salable story + I m not suggesting that you can have it all that s another myth peddled by our consumerist society we all have to make choices along the way that will forever lead us down one path causing us to forsake others + I m not talking about always taking the road less traveled frost after all we don t all need to end up as famous poets + And while we re on the subject of poetic conceits I don t mean to intone that you and you alone are Master of your fate Captain of your soul henley all our fates are dependent on having a little luck at the right times and some fortunate encounters with promising opportunities and amiable companions I know mine has been + I m not recommending you abandon all traditional comforts for a life of daring and unpredictable adventure on the road I recently retired comfortably from a corporate gig after working professionally and continuously from age twenty three to sixty five and I appreciated all of the challenges that came with that + I m not saying that the journey is more important than the destination instead what I m saying is that the journey and the destination are both important but your destination need not be singular and the string of successive destinations need not and perhaps should not be lined up in a neat and foreordained progression + I m not claiming that my particular and peculiar path has led me to fame and fortune but then those were never really among my goals nor would I suggest that they be among yours So here s what I am saying At its best human life can be an open ended adventure of development exploring one possibility after another learning something new from each one becoming something new with each one with a myriad of new paths leading onward from each achieved destination and with only you to pick the path that seems most enticing most intriguing and most promising So no matter how many or how few your years here on Earth and no matter how great or how paltry you may judge your accomplishments to date know that who you are today need not be the final product and that you still have out in front of you opportunities to become something new something greater something not yet realized and perhaps not yet even imagined And so fellow adventurers I implore you to + Stay curious + Open your minds to fresh possibilities + Watch out for blind alleys + Avoid the pigeonholes frost https www poetryfoundation org poems 44272 the

		title: "Hallelujah",
		date: "29 Oct 2020",
    url: "appreciation/hallelujah.html",
		content: "The history of Leonard Cohen s song Hallelujah is a fascinating one Cohen s songs had never really been embraced by the masses and his first recording of Hallelujah in the early eighties was part of an album so lacking in obvious commercial appeal that the president of CBS Records responded to it by saying What is this This isn t pop music We re not releasing it This is a disaster That recording was released however a little later on a small independent label but few people took note of the album or of this particular song Even for Cohen s small set of fans it did not seem like a particularly memorable recording But then a funny series of events began to play out over the next couple of decades John Cale formerly of the Velvet Underground vu and himself not a household name recorded a version of the song for a Cohen tribute album in 1991 Again few took notice Then singer guitarist Jeff Buckley stumbled across Cale s recording while apartment sitting for a friend and he recorded another version of the song in 1994 Buckley suffered an unfortunate and early demise in 1997 However his recording of the song achieved considerable posthumous critical and commercial recognition Then of all things the song was chosen for use in an animated film a little thing called Shrek Cale s version was used in the film itself but yet another version recorded by Rufus Wainwright was used on the soundtrack Both the film and the album were enormous commercial successes and so the song received exposure to an even wider audience Since then of course the song has been mainlined into our collective consciousness and has been sung recorded and played by just about everyone and used to commemorate just about every sort of occasion Cohen himself performed the song during frequent tours in his later years He was asked at one point whether he was growing tired of hearing so many cover versions especially given the wide range of quality in these various performances and recordings To his credit he responded by saying that he was very happy that it was being sung And so he should have been for a songwriter who cared so deeply about his craft it must have given him great satisfaction to see one of his greatest works being sung and appreciated by so many Cohen had said that he had worked on this particular song for a number of years and at some point had written literally scores of different verses for possible use And in fact Cohen himself performed different versions of the song over the years and the many cover versions often pick and choose particular verses for inclusion Cohen of course like most songwriters was reluctant to comment on the meaning of his own work and rightly so if there was another simpler way to communicate what he wanted to say then he wouldn t have had to spend years crafting the song and wouldn t have had to wait decades for his creation to find its audience And yet without meaning any disrespect I would like to make some observations on various pieces of the song how they work together and how they form a whole greater than the sum of the parts a whole with some particular meaning for those who care to listen more deeply I ve tried to assemble a sort of canonical version of the lyrics below including all of the verses sung by Cohen in his studio and live recordings and included in the most popular cover versions If the lyrics in places seem to deviate from oft heard versions it s because in cases of conflict I ve used the words sung by Cohen himself on the Live in London disc recorded in 2009 Let s start however by considering the music The first thing to note is that the music is rather simple and straightforward which is perhaps one reason why so many people have performed it and why so many people have listened to it There is nothing tricky or alternative or difficult about the music The verses have a sort of lilting almost sing song rhythm to them a device that is easy to emulate and difficult to break that music has a sort of life of its own that carries the song along no matter who is singing it Looking at the chorus once again we are struck by the utter simplicity of it just the repetition of that one word Hallelujah to music that is somber reverent seeming to ask a question and then receiving and accepting an answer Cohen packs so much human yearning and resolution into the repetition of this one word But also through the repetition of this one word to form the chorus and then the repetition of the chorus at the end of every verse Cohen manages to convey a sort of steadfast endurance a sense that we humans over the course of our ever rising and falling fortunes always return to this one word these four syllables that give thanks for some kind of wholeness that we manage to forge out of all we experience Now let s turn to the verses The words present one side of a dialogue between the singer and some other figure in his life perhaps a former lover The dialogue is a dispute of sorts arguing in some sense over the meaning of this very word Hallelujah and their respective rights to use it And note that the structure of each verse is the same each starting with words that seem to dismiss and demean any sense of the holy but then returning in the final lines to discover and reveal an enhanced awareness of meaning in their lives rising each time to conclude in this proclamation of Hallelujah > Now I ve heard there was a secret chord > That David played and it pleased the Lord > But you don t really care for music do you > It goes like this > The fourth the fifth > The minor fall the major lift > The baffled king composing Hallelujah The singer songwriter starts out by citing a religious source pointing out that even in the Christian Bible David played a secret chord that pleased the Lord but then recalling that the person he is arguing with doesn t really care much for music But then Cohen proceeds anyway explaining how his song works with the minor fall followed by the major lift and then coming back to a Biblical image of the baffled king composing Hallelujah So what is Cohen arguing for here Some sense of mystery certainly citing the secret chord and the baffled king perhaps in contrast to a more rigid and strict interpretation of when it is appropriate to use this frankly religious term And he also seems to be suggesting that perhaps even a contemporary artist such as himself might hope to emulate David and please the Lord through his music > Your faith was strong but you needed proof > You saw her bathing on the roof > Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you > She tied you > To a kitchen chair > She broke your throne and she cut your hair > And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Cohen then proceeds to tell a story with obvious references to Samson and Delilah from the Bible and in this telling Samson is overthrown by Delilah s beauty when he observes her bathing in the moonlight and yet he utters this word Hallelujah even after losing his power and position and dignity And so now we have Cohen holding up a very worldly beauty and defending our right to use this holy word in gratitude when in its presence > You say I took the name in vain > I don t even know the name > But if I did well really what s it to you > There s a blaze of light > In every word > It doesn t matter which you heard > The holy or the broken Hallelujah Again Cohen s lover seems to argue that such holy language be reserved for usage in a formal religious context but Cohen responds as a contemporary artist living in the material world as it is and yet arguing that there s a blaze of light in every word whether this word Hallelujah is used in praise of some divine order or whether it is used in praise of some other mysterious order that can still be discerned even in this broken world we seem to inhabit > Now maybe there s a God above > As for me all I ve ever learned from love > Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya > But it s not a cry that you hear at night > It s not some pilgrim who claims to have seen the light > It s a cold and it s a broken Hallelujah Here Cohen admits that perhaps there is some God above but then quickly proceeds to return our contemplation of love to a more worldly plane But then he mixes this sense of love this expression of Hallelujah into this worldly pot of love insisting that this feeling of reverence and gratitude is not associated with someone seeking divine revelation but is found with someone suffering from loss of love in this cold and broken world Cohen s message if we can call it that now seems to be clearer he s not impressed with some learned sense of piety associated with an organized religion but wants to share instead some earned sense of wholeness that comes not out of denial of the mortal world but out of a full experience and acceptance of all its pieces In fact Cohen once said that this song came from a desire to affirm my faith in life not in some formal religious way but with enthusiasm with emotion At another time he said This world is full of conflicts and full of things that cannot be reconciled But there are moments when we can reconcile and embrace the whole mess and that s what I mean by Hallelujah > Baby I ve been here before > I know this room and I ve walked this floor > You see I used to live alone before I knew ya > And I ve seen your flag on the marble arch > But love is not some kind of victory march > No it s a cold and it s a very lonely Hallelujah Cohen now tells this other figure that he knows what she is experiencing perhaps after losing a love and experiencing a sense of abandonment But he then goes on to argue that love is not merely a matter of public conquests something we feel when romantically involved with a mate but something that wells out of us even when feeling cold and alone > There was a time when you let me know > What s really going on below > But now you never show it to me do ya > I remember when I moved in you > And the holy dove was moving too > And every breath we drew was Hallelujah Again Cohen reminds this other figure that we find solace not in suppressing our emotions but in fully feeling them and sharing them And he reminds her of the sacred feelings they once felt in the physical act of love > I did my best it wasn t much > I couldn t feel so I learned to touch > I ve told the truth I didn t come to fool you > And even though > It all went wrong > I ll stand before the Lord of Song > With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah Now in this final verse Cohen begins by dismissing his efforts to love this other person not romanticizing them but simply presenting them for what they are But then even with this admission of defeat and failure he makes his final and clearest claim to use of this word he has been repeating standing not before some traditional religious God but before his own ultimate master the Lord of Song with no other word on his lips than Hallelujah What a majestic work Cohen has left us Its words and music are so plain so commonplace and yet it is almost impossible for us to hear them without being lifted up without feeling in the presence of some sort of mystery that we can never fully comprehend and yet that is constantly going on around us If so many of us sing this song Hallelujah or pause to listen to it no matter how many times we have heard it before then perhaps it is because Cohen s work reclaims for all of us our right to use this word to express this benediction to feel this sense of gratitude this sense of wholeness and acceptance no matter what our religious beliefs no matter what our position in this world no matter what loss we suffered yesterday or may suffer tomorrow In dual consideration of Cohen s achievement as well as of his recent demise I am reminded of these words from G K Chesterton gkc First > This is the great fall the fall by which the fish forgets the sea the ox forgets the meadow the clerk forgets the city every man forgets his environment and in the fullest and most literal sense forgets himself This is the real fall of Adam and it is a spiritual fall It is a strange thing that many truly spiritual men such as General Gordon have actually spent some hours in speculating upon the precise location of the Garden of Eden Most probably we are in Eden still It is only our eyes that have changed And then > The center of every man s existence is a dream Death disease insanity are merely material accidents like a toothache or a twisted ankle That these brutal forces always besiege and often capture the citadel does not prove that they are the citadel Like every great artist Cohen has changed the way in which we view the world has restored sight to our blinded eyes He was well aware in his final months that his body was failing him that his life would soon end And yet I hope that in those last days and moments he took some comfort in knowing that not only had he bestowed such a great gift upon the world but that the Lord of Song had looked down upon his work and was happy to hear it being sung on so many lips Hallelujah indeed hallelujah http amzn to 2gc8CmP lc http amzn to 2fudAMD lil http amzn to 2gAXZqG gkc http en wikipedia org wiki G K Chesterton vu http www reasontorock com artists velvet

    url: "blog/hbowie/have-our-political-parties-turned-into-cults.html",
		content: "I recently wrote a piece offering Some Hard Won Wisdom Concerning Cults cults And I ve written a couple of pieces recently questioning the direction of the current Republican Party See The Decline of the Republican Party First Gradually and then Suddenly decline and Where Exactly Are the Republicans Headed where And so today I want to ask the question should either or both of our political parties be considered cults I d like to treat this question seriously rather than simply indulging in the ritualistic name calling that such an inquiry usually provokes So let s go down my prior list of fourteen indicators of a cult cults and try to fairly assess both parties on these criteria Before I begin let me try to clarify the position from which I m writing I m a fairly reliable progressive Democrat and I occasionally write about politics but neither my identity nor my writing are centered around politics or around progressive causes I ve written positive pieces about Trump see What Trump Gets Right trump and critical pieces about the Democrats see The Progressive Problem progprob I write on aesthetic and cultural topics I read and respect traditional conservative authors such as David Brooks brooks and I maintain contacts with friends who are solid Republicans and who voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020 So feel free to agree or disagree with me and to share your own perspective in the comments but I would ask that you avoid any knee jerk labeling of my thoughts in one way or the other So with that out of the way let me start down my list of cult indicators 1 Allegiance to a particular individual or to the individuals belonging to a particular family rather than to an institution an office or a set of principles Now that Trump has been fairly voted out of office and yet most Republican legislators dare not even state openly that he lost the election dare it has become pretty clear that the majority of Republican leaders are exhibiting and advocating for this particular trait There s no similarly charismatic and unifying leader among the Democrats So it s now Republicans 1 Democrats 0 2 A set of people and or proclamations that are offered as infallible indisputable and not to be questioned The Big Lie biglie stating that Trump actually won the election and was somehow cheated out of it is the obvious example here I don t believe there s anything comparable among the Democrats If anything the Democrats seem to suffer because they have trouble agreeing on anything So let s mark the score Republicans 2 Democrats 0 3 The primacy of this group over all others members may also belong to other groups but the group in question insists that it be the primary source of identity and meaning and guidance for its members For followers of Trump this aspect of their identity seems to take precedence over all others And Trump seems to expect and demand such allegiance And I certainly know Democrats for whom their party or progressive causes are their primary source of identity But I don t see any signs that Democrats in general insist on this degree of identification with the party So it s now Republicans 3 Democrats 0 4 A general insistence that the leaders of the group are the only reliable sources of truth all other sources are routinely discredited Trump and his followers and the right wing news sources generally seem to be the sole source of truth for Trump following Republicans and they all spend considerable time discrediting any other sources generally lumping anyone who disagrees with them into the mainstream media bucket so I think it s fair to say the Republicans qualify here I don t see anything similar among Democrats As a matter of fact Democrats seem to value having multiple independent sources of the news and of opinions and value having these two types of journalism clearly distinguished from one another As a personal example I regularly get news and opinions from The New York Times The Washington Post The Seattle Times Mother Jones NPR PBS and Apple News which syndicates content from multiple sources including Fox News None of these news sources spend any time discrediting other news sources nor do they offer a singular monolithic view of the world s events So now it s Republicans 4 Democrats 0 5 Assertions of truth that the followers have no way to test so that there can be no independent verification of the veracity of these statements Assertions of vast left wing conspiracies including the theft of our latest presidential election fall into this category I don t know of anything similar among Democrats So for those keeping score Republicans 5 Democrats 0 6 A bright line drawn between those who are members and those who are not All of the recent shenanigans around removing Liz Cheney from her leadership position seem to be examples here those Republicans daring to challenge the Big Lie are clearly being identified and cut out of the herd I haven t seen anything comparable among Democrats We re now at Republicans 6 Democrats 0 7 A particular label or set of terms used to refer to those who are not members It s interesting and revealing to see the comments about my recent writings coming from those who disagree Here are a few examples > You guys are hilarious I am literally amazed on how the left can create false narratives > Why is the left so confused > The Democrats have been been largely captured by the BLM Woke Left Intersectional Grievance Environmental Alarmist Sexual Identity Hate America Coalition What s interesting to me here is the labeling and grouping that seems to inevitably accompany and generally preface any disagreements with my thoughts even though I ve never used any of these terms either to describe myself or to describe any groups that I might feel myself to be representing And I often hear the same sort of dismissive terminology from friends and family members who are Trump supporters I don t hear any sort of similar consistent derisive labeling from Democrats So let s say Republicans 7 Democrats 0 8 Restrictions on mingling and fraternizing with non members I can t honestly say I know how to judge this one I don t see any signs of this among Democrats but since my Republican friends and relatives aren t speaking to me these days it s hard to tell how it is for them So I ll leave the score unchanged 9 A tendency to preemptively attack the credibility of anyone who has left the fold Trump and his followers have done this so consistently since he took office that I m not sure it s worth citing any specific examples I can t think of any examples for Democrats So let s call it Republicans 8 Democrats 0 10 Open ended expectations of members I think both parties exhibit this trait So now it s Republicans 9 Democrats 1 11 Vaguely defined benefits for members I suppose we should give them both the same score here So we re up to Republicans 10 Democrats 2 12 A lack of transparency about finances and operations of the organization I m sure both parties exhibit some of this at times But certainly Trump and his minions have doubled down on this trait with Trump consistently refusing even to make his tax returns public So let s call it Republicans 11 Democrats 2 13 A lofty purpose towards which the organization makes little substantial progress This might have been in doubt before Trump left office but can there be any question of this now Trump and his followers are still raising money claiming that they will prove that Trump rightfully won the 2020 election and restore him to office even though the Republicans haven t been able to make a single court case stick courts and displayed embarrassing incompetence when trying to recount the votes in Arizona s Maricopa county maricopa And yet Trump and his followers keep insisting that the election results will be overturned and Donald Trump restored to his rightful place in the White House So now it s Republicans 12 Democrats 2 14 A tendency to preemptively assign all of these same attributes listed above to the other however they are labeled thereby making it seem as if the group in question is the only way to avoid cult membership rather than what it is namely a cult itself I m often amazed at how often Trump and his band of Republicans claim that the Democrats are the ones who are guilty of something that the Republicans themselves have done Trump s recent attempt to redefine the current meaning of The Big Lie biglie2 is one recent example But see a prior piece of mine The Shocking Truth About Us Liberals shock for more of my thoughts on how we liberals fail to live up to all of the allegations that the right routinely levels at us And so the the final score is Republicans 13 Democrats 2 Take Aways First of all let me make it clear that at least in this particular piece I m not trying to say that the policy recommendations of the Democrats are any better or worse than those of the Republicans policy issues just don t come into play here So if you think the Democrats are mad spenders but you like the Republicans because they want to limit the power of the federal government then hey more power to you I m not going to debate those points with you today I ll save that for another piece No my single minded purpose today is to take a hard look at this thing that the Republican Party has become in the age of Trump And while I m sure that you and I might disagree on some of my scoring above it seems hard to disagree with the overall conclusion the Republican Party under Trump has now become a full fledged cult And while the Democrats do some pretty stupid things at times and no doubt betray a few of these same traits the bottom line is that they are just not in the same league as the Republicans when it comes to leading and forming a cult Unfortunately for conservatives and the Republican Party they have now thrown their lot in with Trump so completely that they really have no viable alternative when it comes to winning elections So I understand why so many Republican politicians are still sticking with Trump But it s not too late for the rest of us for ordinary citizens like you and me to back away slowly from the cult that the Republican Party has become None of this is meant to state or imply any lack of faith in our country s two party system As Heather Cox Richardson recently pointed out in her Letter from an American dated May 16 2021 letter we need a second party to perform a vital oversight role on whichever party is now in office but the Republicans are even failing at that So I think the time has come to turn away from Trump and his organization and do whatever we think we can to form something new It s not a liberal thing or a conservative thing it s just a matter of remaining a member of a cult or walking away Take care biglie2 https www washingtonexaminer com news liz cheney trump big lie biglie

		content: "Let us briefly review some of the significant events in the history of personal computing 1983 Steve Jobs lures CEO John Sculley from Pepsi to Apple Computer asking him > Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world 1984 Football fans watching the Super Bowl see a now famous advertisement In this sixty second commercial 1984 a blond athletic brightly attired young woman heaves a huge hammer towards a grey talking head broadcasting bc a message of oppressive unity to a seated emaciated multitude The hammer shatters the screen terminating the transmission and we then hear > On January 24th Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh And you ll see why 1984 won t be like 1984 1990 Steve Jobs remarks in an interview for the Library of Congress > The computer is the most remarkable tool that we ve ever come up with It s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds 2018 iPhone says > Weekly Report Available You averaged 57 minutes of screen time last week Whoa What happened between 1990 and 2018 Who stuck the playing card between the spokes spokes of my mind s bicycle turning a mental enabler into an annoying distraction I started programming mainframes in 1974 I can still remember the excitement of possessing my own personal computer back in the eighties I can recall the thrill of learning how to use a graphical user interface and a mouse with my first Mac I still vividly remember downloading my CD collection to my first iPod and being able to carry my entire music library in my pocket And I have fond memories of installing my first iPhone apps from the online store Perhaps most tellingly I maintained a subscription to at least one monthly Mac magazine starting with Macworld and MacUser and continuing with MacAddict continuously from the mid eighties to sometime in 2018 when I finally let my subscription to MacLife lapse In hindsight I can see the following distinct models of computer usage that have emerged over the years with varying degrees of utility 1 The Mainframe model Huge expensive computers used to store and process organizational data 2 The Personal Computer Model Small affordable computers that can be used at home by individuals 3 The Gaming Model Well you know computers used to play games 4 The Office PC Model Small affordable computers that can be used by office workers at their desks powered by increasingly powerful and complex application suites especially designed to allow such workers to spend hours fiddling with obscure options fonts styles and formulas all while claiming to be doing work 5 The iPod Model Computers you can carry with you used for mobile personal entertainment 6 The Internet Model Everyone can communicate with everyone else more or less instantaneously and at little or no cost What could possibly go wrong Inevitably the value of each individual communication decreases in direct inverse correspondence to the total number of communications sent and received Note that by combining the Office PC Model with the Internet Model office workers effectively freed themselves from the necessity of ever leaving their desks while at work while at the same time effectively shrouding their efforts from any sort of managerial oversight 7 The All the World s Mis Information at your Fingertips Model Huge amounts of information become instantaneously accessible to everyone with a Web browser In particular think of Wikipedia and Google 8 The E Commerce Model Businesses use computers to sell stuff directly to consumers as well as to other businesses 9 The User Interface as Fashion Statement Model Applications and application upgrades as well as operating system upgrades are appreciated not just for their functionality or ease of use but for their overall aesthetics In 2000 when introducing Mac OS X Steve Jobs says with pride that We made the buttons on the screen look so good you ll want to lick them We begin to talk about visual interfaces as becoming stale and needing to be freshened 10 The Content Farms Model Vast troves of text audio and video become easily and instantaneously accessible either for free or at low monthly rental rates The value of each individual piece of content diminishes again in direct inverse proportion as the sheer volume increases Users no longer have much interest in individual works but rather seek to immerse themselves in the collections swimming mindlessly for hours at a time through seas of content 11 The Technology for Its Own Sake Model Technology begins to be appreciated simply because it is new and because it is affordable This is the age of voice activated speakers programmable lighting hackable front door locks and entertainment systems so complex that they require intensive training just to watch TV 12 The Ubiquitous Advertising Model Most things are free and everything free or not comes with advertising We now have one set of technical forces working to continually show us the most effective advertising while another works to block the ads Net value created vc zero 13 The Eyeballs for Sale Model Computers are no longer delivered with languages that would allow their users to program them Instead computers are used to program their owners telling them what to buy where to buy it and who to vote for Whereas personal computers were originally intended to enhance and encourage individuality ind they are now used to sort us into various predictable demographic groups 14 The Intrusive Model It is no longer enough that computers be available to do our bidding They now buzz vibrate play complex tonal sequences show videos and even talk to us when they feel that it is time for us to pay attention to them Everyplace we look there is one device or another wanting us to see what is new or what is trending To be fair all of these different usage models have some things to recommend them none are completely evil or worthless And yet at some point along this progression the amount of time and energy and money and attention demanded by all this technology seems at least for me to outweigh any conceivable benefits The net effect of all this is that I begin to feel the need for a Jimmy Buffett style rant fruitcakes after a while > I don t want it I don t want that much organization in my life I don t want other people thinking for me Where did the headphone jack go I don t want to buy another dongle for 25 dollars Where did the home button go I don t want an edge to edge screen for $1 000 I WANT MY HOME BUTTON Where did the Control Center go Why do I have to learn a new place to find the flashlight button every time Jony Ive gets a hot flash Why do I have to pay an annual fee to Microsoft just for the privilege of being able to read and write a bunch of word docs How did Mark Zuckerberg get as rich as Croesus by selling information about me WHEN I M STILL WAITING TO SEE THE FIRST RED CENT We need more fruitcakes in this world and fewer Tech Titans We need people that care I m mad as hell and I don t want to take it anymore And so these days I m favoring a bit more simplicity in my life I ve practically become the Henry David Thoreau thoreau of the modern tech world trading the shores of Walden Pond pond for those of Green Lake gl sitting in my wooden cabin with nothing but my rustic iMac a trusty text editor bbedit and a workable copy of Markdown md So when pundits rush to tell us how further advances in technology are going to become even more pervasive in all of our lives and eliminate all our jobs well I have my doubts Here s why 1 Computer hardware becomes obsolete quickly If a piece of tech is still useful after three years we consider it a minor miracle I don t see this changing 2 Computer software never lives up to all the hype This is why despite all of the expensive developers and vast server farms the Internet mostly shows me ads for things I ve already purchased or things I would never buy in a million years 3 Software maintenance is crazy expensive Most industry experts will readily attest that developers spend at least ten times as much time in maintenance as they do in development 4 Rewriting software is even more expensive and failure prone That s why companies are still running software written in COBOL and Java and are not in any hurry to rewrite it using the latest tech stack to be touted as the Next Big Thing 5 The best i e most valuable decisions are still made by smart capable experienced knowledgeable people not by big data and algorithms An example A couple of days ago I visited an Apple store to do some Christmas shopping There was a line outside the door before they opened and they were selling stuff left and right as soon as people entered And then today I came across this interview with Ron Johnson johnson telling his story of how he and Steve Jobs and a few others in Apple designed the original Apple stores Guess what the only computers they used were the ones customers would see to make full sized store prototypes Definitely worth a read 6 We will continue to see rebellion against the model of human life that reduces all experience to an unending stream of bits This is why vinyl recordings are experiencing a resurgence why independent bookstores are still around why live theatre and concerts are still attracting audiences and why the best colleges and universities are turning qualified students away even with the increasing cost of tuition 7 Using computers to program customers is a very short term strategy It s already damaging our society One way or another it s not going to last long either we ll collectively turn towards a longer term strategy or there won t be customers or companies around much longer 8 Ditto for apps that are constantly interrupting whatever we re doing to tell us the latest bit of inanity 9 The entire goal of society is to create and support an ongoing sustainable stream of healthy happy humans If that is not what society is doing then some adjustments will need to be made 10 At their best humans are far more adaptive and longer lasting than any computing technology yet invented or likely to be invented in the future We don t need better artificial intelligence we do need smarter better educated humans 1984 https www mac history net apple history tv ads 2011 07 12 1984 the

    url: "blog/hbowie/help-help-the-robots-are-coming.html",
		content: "Many pundits today are predicting a future of robots equipped with artificial intelligence so powerful that they will essentially render great swaths of humanity obsolete Historian and author Yuval Noah Harari harari for example recently painted an interesting picture of such a tomorrow in his article for The Guardian titled The meaning of life in a world without work harari wwow He foresees a world in which a universal basic income would allow the unemployable masses to spend increasing amounts of time mucking about in virtual worlds rather than doing anything useful in the real one Let me just make a few points concerning such imaginings 1 To start with the prosaic so far there are no signs that vast quantities of human labor won t be needed to help sustain and renew any form of human technology Look at how much you paid for your smart phone either directly or indirectly and how quickly the thing goes out of date This is not an anomaly in the world of technology it is the norm The same thing is happening behind the scenes in every enterprise on the planet as computing systems age and teeter for years on the brink of outright obsolescence because it is too expensive to replace them with newer systems So if you are trying to tell me that we will soon see a world where all these systems don t require regular maintenance repair and replacement then I ve got an Osborne 1 osborne 1 to sell you 2 We humans have become the dominant species on our planet precisely because we are the most adaptive And in modern times we have learned to adapt not just to changing external factors in our environment but to changes wrought by our own species After all many of today s jobs such as computer programmer did not exist a few decades ago yet millions of humans have learned how to make their livings by learning to be productive at jobs like these So while we may have trouble now envisioning exactly how we will adapt to changes in our future including increasingly powerful robots it seems short sighted to think that we can t successfully learn to live with such things 3 It makes me feel positively schizophrenic to read articles such as Harari s predicting a world in which there is nothing for people to do right alongside other articles about our crumbling infrastructure and others talking about the incredible sustainability challenges we are facing on our planet As a species we certainly seem to have a lot of work that needs doing that isn t getting done I would suggest we focus on working that pile down before starting to lose sleep about what on earth we will do with ourselves if and when we run out of meaningful work 4 Articles that talk speculatively about the emergence of a useless class of people made redundant by new technology wondering what their lives might be like seem to ignore the fact that such experiments are already underway and are not turning out particularly well If we look at the numbers of people today who are unemployed or underemployed or suffering from substance abuse or binging on media consumption it is hard to see a rosy picture emerging of how wonderful useless lives will be in the future 5 While I agree with Harari that many cultural elements of human belief systems are somewhat arbitrary and are created by humanity not handed down from on high I don t believe we can successfully manufacture completely synthetic belief systems just to keep useless people amused We humans tend to create belief systems for ourselves that help us cooperate with one another in increasingly complex patterns of interactions that efficiently achieve some collective purpose whether it be building the pyramids sending a man to the moon or achieving a sustainable human culture on planet Earth We are certainly not perfect at this and it s easy to find examples of our miscues and of instances where these cultural beliefs outlived their usefulness but in the long run it s what we tend to do Yes we make stuff up but we tend to make up useful things 6 If we are worried about what to do with useless people it might be worthwhile to apply Eli Goldratt goldratt s Theory of Constraints goldratt toc and Critical Chain goldratt cc thinking to the problem of how to produce useful people Looking though this lens one might be tempted to say that as a species we have applied too many resources to the task of producing more people and not enough resources to the tasks of educating these people to be smart informed and adaptive members of society One might also look at the quantities of arable land and clean fresh water as critical resources whose constraints need to be respected and taken into account 7 Whenever we are tempted to think of coming waves of new technology as implacable forces threatening to dwarf any individual efforts we might make we might want to consider some of the words and deeds of those who have helped to shape the world we inhabit today > Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world Indeed it is the only thing that ever has > > Margaret Mead mm American Cultural Anthropologist > When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world Try not to bash into the walls too much Try to have a nice family have fun save a little money > > That s a very limited life Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it you can influence it you can build your own things that other people can use > > Steve Jobs sj co founder and long time CEO of Apple arguably the world s most valuable company > Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge That s what we re doing > > Jimmy Wales wales co founder of Wikipedia > It s only recently that I ve come to understand that writers are not marginal to our society that they in fact do all our thinking for us that we are writing myths and our myths are believed and that old myths are believed until someone writes a new one > > Kurt Vonnegut kv author of novels such as Cat s Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five > The world is a wonderfully weird place consensual reality is significantly flawed no institution can be trusted certainty is a mirage security a delusion and the tyranny of the dull mind forever threatens but our lives are not as limited as we think they are all things are possible laughter is

    url: "blog/hbowie/how-to-fix-big-tech.html",
		content: "We all sort of know the problems right Monopolies Lock in Stream addiction Reality bubbles Billionaires seeking market dominance All other values taking a back seat to growth I don t think I need to elaborate If you re reading this then you re probably well aware of all these concerns But what do we do about them Here are a couple of ideas Radical but practical And very doable Mandate a Separation of Powers In all of the areas where we have these concerns we really have three separate and very separable sorts of activities going on Content creation Content packaging and distribution Content viewing Notice that the original architects of the World Wide Web got this right lots of different content creators lots of different hosting companies and platforms neutral delivery pipes multiple ways of organizing and packaging content portals search engines etc lots of different clients web browsers and eventually other sorts of more specialized apps as well to view this content But look at where we re at today Facebook content creation packaging distribution and viewing all being controlled by a single company Instagram ditto plus being controlled by the same company Facebook Twitter the same Netflix content creation packaging and distribution all controlled by a single company Fox News content creation packaging and distribution all controlled by a single company And I could go on Do we have to put up with this Nah Chris Hughes made a great point recently in his New York Times opinion piece titled It s Time to Break Up Facebook hughes I can t say it any better so I ll quote extensively here > America was built on the idea that power should not be concentrated in any one person because we are all fallible That s why the founders created a system of checks and balances They didn t need to foresee the rise of Facebook to understand the threat that gargantuan companies would pose to democracy Jefferson and Madison were voracious readers of Adam Smith who believed that monopolies prevent the competition that spurs innovation and leads to economic growth > > A century later in response to the rise of the oil railroad and banking trusts of the Gilded Age the Ohio Republican John Sherman said on the floor of Congress If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production transportation and sale of any of the necessities of life If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 outlawed monopolies More legislation followed in the 20th century creating legal and regulatory structures to promote competition and hold the biggest companies accountable The Department of Justice broke up monopolies like Standard Oil and AT T So the key question is not whether we can break up a company like Facebook If we have the political will to do so then it can certainly be done We ve done it before But I think a question of at least equal importance is how we should break up such companies Here s my proposal we should mandate through new anti monopoly laws the separation of content creation and viewing from content packaging and distribution How would this work That s where the next part of the proposal comes in Open Standards In order to make this work we would need open standards for content publishing and content viewing These already exist in many areas and we take them for granted today Think about email for a minute And try not to focus on the problems of spam and your overflowing inbox those are topics for a different day You can compose and send an email from a Mac from a Windows PC or from your smart phone And for each of these you can choose a client for composing and sending those messages You can choose your email provider Apple mail or Gmail or FastMail fm or something else And even though you may send an email to me using Gmail on your Android device I can read it without any problems sitting at my iMac and using the Airmail am app Why should social messaging be so different Why is it that in order to keep up with what my brother is doing in Virginia while I sit here in Seattle we both have to be 100 locked in to Facebook for the whole experience The difference quite simply is that we have widely recognized open standards for email but not for social messaging Open standards allow interoperability and that enables competition and that provides choice And let s face it Despite what the leaders of these various messaging services will try to tell us the differences between them are not so great that it would be hard to arrive at standards allowing interoperability What are we sending A few photos links and or a bit of text Can we come up with open standards for content like this You bet we can A project called Mastodon mast is already paving the way demonstrating how this can be done This is not rocket science folks We can do this Again all it requires is political will More About Packaging Note that my proposal above was to separate content creation and viewing from packaging and distribution Let me drill down on the packaging piece of that equation for a minute What I mean by packaging especially for social media is the composition of a stream of content to be presented to an individual for viewing Today if I want to keep up with my friends on Facebook then I have no choice but to allow Facebook to compose that stream for me Which means that I have no idea why I m seeing certain bits of content and I have no idea what other content I might be missing With my proposal I would have a choice of providers for packaging and distribution Maybe some of them would allow me to pay a small fee so I wouldn t have to see any ads Maybe some of them as with DuckDuckGo ddg in the web search space would show ads but without personally tracking me Maybe some of them would allow me to view the actual algorithm being used to compose my feed Maybe some of them would even allow me to tweak that algorithm or write my own Perhaps some would be nonprofits and run on donations à la Wikipedia Who knows how many options would emerge But I would have a choice and a free and open market would then be able to create a variety of solutions to satisfy a bunch of different situations and needs Choice is doubly important because when I have to make decisions about which service I ll choose I ll think more carefully about how those services work and what they re doing for and to me When people don t have a choice they tend to just accept what they re given and don t think much more about it And we need to think carefully and make conscious choices about what media is being fed to us and why Overthrowing the Tyranny of Free Part of the resistance to breaking up the big tech monopolies comes from the old idea that the entire point of anti trust is to reduce prices paid by consumers And since of course companies like Facebook and Google and Twitter make their money on the collection and commercial use of our personal information and not on direct sales to consumers this traditional argument doesn t hold much weight However as open source advocate Richard Stallman rs says in talking about free software fs we need to think about free as in free speech not free beer Today many of the tech giants are offering us the media equivalent of free beer But our speech is increasingly being controlled and constrained and harnessed for profit by these same big tech monopolies Freedom of speech is not just about everyone getting to say whatever they want It s also the freedom to control how our speech is used and the freedom to choose what speech we pay attention to These are the freedoms we re sacrificing today by using companies that charge no fees for their services We re Not Talking Socialism Here Don t get me wrong I m not against capitalism or capitalists cap I m all for entrepreneurial innovation and making money And I m OK with providing a decent return on investment for first movers But capitalism is about more than just generating new unicorns uni and then watching them grow fatter and fatter Capitalism is primarily about enabling competition among providers providing choice to consumers and serving society To paraphrase John Sherman js and to update his focus a bit to reflect our current concerns > If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a handful of kings over the necessary communication channels of modern life > > If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to a few autocrats of the news and social media with power to prevent competition and to reap endless financial gains through the commodification of our social discourse Bottom Line It s clear that the big digital media companies today have too much power concentrated in too few hands But let s be smart about how to fix this problem And let s not be afraid to face it head on We don t need more congressional hearings that just provide these same media outlets with another day s worth of political posturing that they can serve up to entertain their viewers We need legislative action And we need legislation that will serve us not just for one or two news cycles or even one or two election cycles but that will stand the test of time and serve the American people over the long haul We can do it It s nothing we haven t done before It s just one of those things we ve been putting off for too long while we ve been glued

		title: "How to Listen to Music",
		date: "12 Jan 2017",
    url: "blog/hbowie/how-to-listen-to-music.html",
		content: "I can determine with some precision when music began to matter to me Until I was about 12 1 2 music was something that played in the background at times but to which I paid no real attention I heard it mostly on AM radio am It meant nothing to me Then quite suddenly with no warning in the middle of January 1964 I heard The Beatles beatles for the first time singing I Want to Hold Your Hand It s hard to overstate what a shock this was To start with for kids growing up at the beginning of the sixties there were very few music sources available You had popular AM radio that your parents listened to you had the occasional classical music concert forced on you by well meaning teachers and perhaps a stereo in the corner of your living room and a few dusty LP s That was it And then there were the sounds that came through those sources Based on everything I had heard up to that point music was intended as a form of sedation Immediately prior to the arrival of The Beatles the top songs on the radio top40 were There I ve Said It Again by Bobby Vinton and Dominique by The Singing Nun The sounds were soothing and mellow intended to relax the listener and to avoid any kind of stimulation This was also the heyday of Muzak instrumental music recorded specifically to even further remove any meaning the music might accidentally have had for anyone It was played in elevators and offices It was specifically designed marketed and sold to be used as innocuous background music As far as I could tell though there was little difference between this and the original stuff on AM radio at the time by the likes of Andy Williams and Perry Como In contrast to all of this pablum the early music of The Beatles sounded like something entirely different It was urgent pulsing throbbing exciting It was meant to get listeners up on their feet to get them involved to clap their hands not to help them peacefully doze off or to improve their office productivity And while the lyrics were not yet sophisticated the singers were clearly boys only a few years older than myself who had something important that they wanted to communicate not ancient recording artists crooning meaningless ditties in order to keep my parents calm and relaxed For the next few years AM Top 40 radio and that stereo in the corner became vital parts of my life Much of what found its way to the radio was still tripe but it was also the place to hear the latest from The Beatles The Rolling Stones and other emerging rock bands And for a few dollars I could purchase an entire album of music from one of my favorite groups and listen to it on that stereo in the corner as often as I wanted to By the time I hit college at the end of the sixties FM radio stations were being added to the mix with higher fidelity music reproduction and without the commercial constraints that AM radio stations suffered under Entire albums were sometimes played along with longer cuts from albums whether they had been released as singles or not This was also about the time that Rolling Stone rs magazine became available an entire periodical devoted to rock music and related topics with writers of real intelligence and insight talking about the music itself and not the favorite foods and colors preferred by the band members It was also during my college years that I upped my game in terms of a stereo system purchasing a better amplifier and bigger speakers and a high quality turntable from Acoustic Research ar I was beginning to write record reviews for The Michigan Daily michdaily and I needed to make sure that I was hearing a reasonably accurate reproduction of the music that the artist had recorded It s hard to overstate how important music of this era was to me and to many others of my generation It was not playing in the background it was in the foreground of our lives front and center By this time led by Bob Dylan dylan songwriters were crafting lyrics that were more sophisticated and more meaningful and the music being played included a whole spectrum of instruments and styles Many of us considered ourselves part of a counterculture and it was the music of the era that expressed and shaped our attitudes and values As just one example when four students from Kent State University were shot by our National Guard during a peaceful protest against the war in Vietnam in 1970 it was Neil Young s song Ohio written recorded and released within weeks of the event that communicated its significance to us > Tin soldiers and Nixon coming > We re finally on our own > This summer I hear the drumming > Four Dead in Ohio Music continued its important role in my life after college even as the underlying technology I used to listen to it continued to evolve Compact Discs cd began to replace the old record albums in the eighties While there were some trade offs both CDs and CD players were less susceptible to physical wear and tear and gradual sound degradation and in general I made the switch without any sense of loss Then at the start of our current millennium iTunes appeared Before long I was able to rip my entire CD collection to a hard drive giving me the freedom to organize and play my music from my computer in ways never before possible And as hard drive capacities rose and prices fell I was eventually able to maintain my entire CD collection online in a slightly compressed format Apple Lossless alac that sacrificed none of the sound quality of the original CD So by this point I could listen to my entire music collection in three different ways While at my desk I can listen to my lossless collection on high quality speakers or headphones directly attached to my computer Using Apple TV and wi fi I can play my lossless collection over the media system in my living room using a real amplifier and real speakers While traveling near or far I can listen to a compressed but still listenable version of my collection that fits on my iPhone I ve written extensively at ReasonToRock com r2r about the depth of meaning that I ve found in the best rock music When I listen to music now whether it is old or new rock or blues or jazz I want that music to have meaning for me I want to know what they re saying and how they re saying it and who wrote the song and when it was recorded and who is singing and playing and who they were influenced by and who else they ve played with Music is too important to me to be listened to in any other way too important to be trifled with And if the music that is playing doesn t stand up to that depth of inquiry doesn t bear that sort of inspection then I d rather not have to listen to it Please Just turn it off Of course times have changed again in the last several years Streaming services are the next big thing Even Apple has finally gotten into the game ignoring Steve Jobs judgment that people want to own their music I tried Apple Music apple music for a while and it s great to be able to choose to listen to any track at any time from such a huge catalog but eventually decided it wasn t for me for a number of reasons Here s a little story that illustrates my first problem with streaming I was recently shopping in the REI flagship store in Seattle rei when I became aware of a female singer on the store s sound system doing an interesting version of a Stones song from the early seventies I couldn t quite place the voice but the Customer Support desk was right in front of me so I wandered over and asked them who we were listening to His response Oh that s playing from a streaming service The controls are locked away in an office upstairs that only the manager can access I couldn t tell you who it is And so there you have neatly illustrated my first problem with music streaming it s too easy to just use it as a modern form of muzak something pleasant to play in the background but quite devoid of meaning or significance My next problem with streaming My attitude towards music is quite similar to Raymond Chandler chandler s feelings about the Detective Story murder > There are no vital and significant forms of art there is only art and precious little of that The growth of populations has in no way increased the amount it has merely increased the adeptness with which substitutes can be produced and packaged So the idea of asking a streaming service to play me a random sampling of tunes from a certain era or genre is not appealing to me I typically want to listen to something I consider to be great in some way If it s great music then bring it on and then I really don t care about its genre or period or tempo or what mood it supposedly evokes My third and final problem with streaming is that the quality of the music reproduction typically seems to not be of much concern it s transmitted in a fairly compressed form and then often played on cheap equipment so even if the original recording was worth listening to it s often quite thin and trashed by the time it reaches my ears So after all this history what are my recommendations for how to listen to music Avoid treating music like background noise Once you start thinking of it like this it s a hard habit to break Next thing you know you ll be wallpapering your bathroom with Picassos Listen with reasonable fidelity This means a decent volume played over decent equipment equipment Know something about what you re listening to Get to know the lyrics Research the artist and recording All Music allmusic is a great resource Seek out great music no matter whether it is popular or current or fashionable Look for others willing to tell you their personal favorites and why they find them so meaningful Listen to a real person who is selecting the music playing it and talking knowledgeably about it you know a DJ A community radio station like KNKX in Seattle is a great home for these sorts of people Go out to see some live music occasionally It helps your favorite artists financially and it helps you get closer to the music Listen to the same music repeatedly If it s worth listening to then you ll get more out of it with repeated listening Pay attention and open yourself to the music I don t mean you can t be doing something else while you re listening but be prepared each time to hear something new even from something you ve heard 100 times before In short

		title: "Humanism and the Practical Utopian",
		date: "28 Jun 2018",
    url: "blog/hbowie/humanism-and-the-practical-utopian.html",
		content: "The first Practopian core principle humanism states that We are humanistic we are focused on human concerns and human potential The primary intent behind this statement is to signal that we don t claim to represent any authority other than our own very human selves and that we focus on the interests of ourselves and our fellow humans However there are a whole host of Humanist organizations orgs already in existence around the globe representing a Humanist movement of sorts and so it may be helpful to comment on how I see the Society for Practical Utopians practopians in relationship to these other brands of humanism The Amsterdam Declaration A good place to start is with The Amsterdam Declaration amsterdam which can be found on the website for the IHEU International Humanist and Ethical Union It s worth noting how directly this document reflects many of the core Practopian beliefs Following is the Declaration with parenthetical links to show correlations with the corresponding Practopian beliefs 1 Humanism is ethical It affirms the worth dignity and autonomy liberty of the individual individuals and the right of every human being to the greatest possible freedom compatible with the rights of others Humanists have a duty of care to all of humanity including future generations mission Humanists believe that morality is an intrinsic part of human nature based on understanding and a concern for others connection needing no external sanction 2 Humanism is rational critical thinking It seeks to use science science creatively not destructively Humanists believe that the solutions to the world s problems lie in human thought and action individuals rather than divine intervention Humanism advocates the application of the methods of science and free inquiry to the problems of human welfare But Humanists also believe that the application of science and technology must be tempered by human values Science gives us the means but human values must propose the ends balance integral 3 Humanism supports democracy democracy and human rights equality Humanism aims at the fullest possible development of every human being education It holds that democracy and human development are matters of right The principles of democracy and human rights can be applied to many human relationships and are not restricted to methods of government 4 Humanism insists that personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility society Humanism ventures to build a world on the idea of the free person responsible to society and recognizes our dependence on and responsibility for the natural world about the principles and values about Humanism is undogmatic imposing no creed upon its adherents written word It is thus committed to education education free from indoctrination 5 Humanism is a response to the widespread demand for an alternative to dogmatic religion The world s major religions claim to be based on revelations fixed for all time and many seek to impose their world views on all of humanity Humanism recognizes that reliable knowledge of the world and ourselves arises through a continuing process of observation evaluation and revision science critical thinking 6 Humanism values artistic creativity and imagination and recognizes the transforming power of art art and storytelling art Humanism affirms the importance of literature music and the visual and performing arts for personal development and fulfillment 7 Humanism is a lifestance aiming at the maximum possible fulfillment through the cultivation of ethical and creative living and offers an ethical and rational means of addressing the challenges of our times Humanism can be a way of life for everyone everywhere So there you have it seven concise paragraphs summarizing the basic tenets of Humanism I certainly see enough correlation here that I would have no problem saying that The Practical Utopian is a Humanist organization On the other hand it s also worth pointing out some areas of difference Belief in the Value of the Written Word The Practopian Creed creed places explicit value on the written word whereas the Amsterdam Declaration goes out of its way to say that it imposes no creed upon its adherents This is a nicely egalitarian sentiment but it also can leave one wondering exactly what it means to be a humanist In fact when visiting the American Humanist Association s website aha I can find no mention of the Amsterdam Declaration and instead find a Humanist Manifesto manifesto along with a page listing no less than eight separate definitions of Humanism defs All of this is liable to give the impression that humanism can mean whatever one wants it to mean While I admire the spirit of inclusion I wonder about the value of a word that has so many different definitions and the value of an organization that cannot neatly and consistently summarize its core beliefs In contrast what I ve tried to do at Practopian org practopians is to provide a very clear concise definition of core beliefs but then expand on these through a set of relevant but less fundamental quotations and blog posts Consistent with its lack of explicit emphasis on the value of the written word humanism also makes no mention of the importance of the rule of law law Acknowledging the Complexities of Cultural Evolution Humanistic writings seem to neatly divide human cultural development into two and only two phases an age of supernatural religious belief followed by an awakening to science and rationality And then most of these same writings go on to imply that if all the dullards in the room would just move along to that second phase the rest of us could get on with living our oh so fulfilling lives In contrast the Practopian beliefs make a point of acknowledging that human cultural evolution cultevo is a more complex nuanced and creative affair Our beliefs make room for more than two stages devlevels of our human development we accept that these different stages work together in parallel and we allow room for further development in an open ended fashion On the one hand we have no delusions about even the best of us being perfectly rational imperfection at the same time we also acknowledge that no matter how rational and scientific we are even those admirable traits will not always be enough to allow us to reach easy agreement on the thorniest of human problems especially when we consider the complex social economic and ecological systems systems in which we live Parents and Families The Practopian beliefs include parenthood as a core value calling out the responsibility of parents to raise their children to become healthy happy productive adults In contrast neither the Amsterdam Declaration nor the Humanist Manifesto mention parenting children or families It is almost as if they expect humans to pop into existence as fully formed rational freethinking adults Economics Practopian beliefs explicitly embrace the concepts of both private and public property as well as motivational rewards for value creation value Humanism takes no side in these issues implying equal support for socialism and capitalism or perhaps a general indifference to economic issues such as these Attitudes towards God and Religion Humanist writings consistently position their movement as specifically and primarily anti God Paragraph 5 of the Amsterdam Declaration cited above is one example Even more strongly the top line of the American Humanist Association s website aha offers the slogan of Good Without a God and then goes on to say that they are advocating progressive values and equality for humanists atheists and freethinkers Practopian beliefs differ here in several important ways First the core beliefs and principles very intentionally make no mention of God or religion The closest they get is to say that we place no faith in any single text that we deem to be sacred Next we acknowledge along with writers such as Ken Wilber wilber and Albert Einstein here einstein1 and here einstein2 that there are different kinds of religious beliefs and feelings that these are important parts of our human cultural development and that we need to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater when dealing with these And finally we Practopians choose not to focus our energy and attention on divisions between religious folk and the non religious As research from the World Values Survey wvs shows many factors influence our societal evolution from traditional to secular values but the primary forces are economic ones as societies transition from agrarian to industrial to knowledge based economies So rather than emphasize our differences along this particular fault line we choose to focus our attention on common concerns issues Summary Since Humanists position themselves as offering an alternative to traditional religion it may be fair to say that the Practopian beliefs offer an alternative to traditional humanism One might think of the Practopians as Humanism+ I think it s fair to say that we start with the basic humanistic beliefs but then go on to flesh

		content: "What does it mean to be human This must certainly be a foundational question for all of us when contemplating almost any aspect of our existence And while any brief answer to this question must admittedly be no more than a starting point for further discussion I think it perhaps worthwhile to provide such a beginning And so here they are the primary traits we share that I think make us uniquely human 1 Part of Nature When Darwin first suggested that humans shared a common ancestry with apes and other animals many people were shocked by the notion But Darwin s principles of evolution are now considered to be scientific fact by the vast majority of responsible scientists in biology and related fields DNA analysis now indicates that the closest relatives to chimpanzees are humans 1 and close study of apes increasingly indicates they are more like us 2 than we might have once wanted to believe 2 Hands and Arms The combination of an upright posture with hands and arms allows us to interact with each other and with the world around us in interesting ways including the fashioning and use of tools 3 Use of Symbols Humans use a variety of symbols to help us understand and manipulate the world around us These symbols include diagrams pictures photographs graphic icons words math and natural language These symbols often represent items in the physical world around us Collections of symbols help us to understand ourselves each other and the material world 4 Temporal Sense We understand ourselves to be time travelers Human individuals groups and their creations have starting and ending points in time and we understand our lives as series of interactions that influence our journeys and our destinations This sense of time includes an understanding of our own physical mortality the intertwined facts that we exist and are alive today but one day we will not be alive and will cease to exist as a functioning organism In fact one of the great contributions of Darwin was to greatly expand our understanding of the length of time that our planet has been in existence the length of time that life has existed on our planet and the way that life has evolved over these vast temporal expanses 5 Cultural Evolution We humans develop sets of languages beliefs knowledge stories behaviors and attitudes that we call cultures We use these cultures to organize ourselves into groups allowing us to work together to achieve goals that we could not accomplish as isolated individuals These cultures have the ability to replicate themselves from one person or group to another and from one generation to another These cultures also have the ability to evolve to allow us to adapt more effectively to our ever changing environment While other species adapt to their environments and ensure their continued survival through genetic evolution humans have for several millennia largely achieved these same goals through cultural evolution cult Compared to the relatively slow pace of genetic evolution cultural evolution takes place fairly rapidly and compared to the advantages conferred by genetic evolution the advantages of cultural evolution have allowed us as a species to reach a state where we have few if any survival threats posed by other species 6 Storytelling Humans tell stories art to themselves and each other Our anthropological records indicate that story telling using one medium or another has been a habit of humanity for as long as we can consider our ancestors to have been human The significance of stories is amplified by the consideration that all of the uniquely human traits listed above items 2 through 5 come together in the practice of story telling Stories tell of human deeds The various actors and entities that populate any story are a form of symbolism Stories by definition take place over some period of time and therefore incorporate and represent our sense of the temporal And among the other forms of information that constitute human culture stories inevitably make up a significant and deeply cherished component So there you have it A deceptively simple list of six traits And yet I find that much of my other thinking and speaking and writing on a variety of topics is based on these foundational beliefs so it seemed worthwhile to get these out in the open If we can agree on these then there s much more worth discussing But if we disagree here then we re not likely to make much progress in other areas 1 quotes chimps and humans html 2 quotes apes and humans html art tags art html cult tags cultural evolution html evolution tags evolution html"

		content: "It may seem odd to advance a belief in imperfection as a key idea to be embraced but there are several reasons for its importance First as Voltaire wisely said enemy Perfect is the enemy of good Elaborating on this idea Robert Watson Watt who developed early warning radar in Britain during WW II propounded a cult of the imperfect He went on to explain Give them the third best to go on with the second best comes too late the best never comes This idea became a central tenet of many business improvement programs ci over the last few decades because it happily trades off a very theoretical and elusive perfection at some distant point in the future in exchange for smaller incremental and very real short term improvements This idea also underlies the software development principle calling for Just Enough Design Up Front jeduf acknowledging that trying to perfect a big design before actual coding begins often results in an unworkable system But a Practopian belief in imperfection is also necessary for consistency with our beliefs in balance and in an integral perspective If we believe that we have a perfect approach then why try to balance it against others And if we already have the perfect perspective then why try to integrate the views of others A belief in perfection can lead to stasis and stagnation For example if we believe that our nation is perfect or that our form of government is perfect then we will likely not tolerate criticism of it and will stop trying to improve it On the other hand if we admit that however good it may be it is still imperfect we will remain open to ideas for further refinement A belief in imperfection is also necessary to achieve the sort of humility that is required to accommodate beliefs in equality and diversity If we believe that we are perfect or are part of a perfect group of people then we will naturally start to look down on others unlike ourselves as inferior An understanding of our own imperfection also allows us to laugh at ourselves from time to time and to fully appreciate some of the sillier aspects of our humanity Without this ability to laugh at ourselves it is hard for us to fully connect with others since we will instead hide our true selves behind a shield of pretended perfection and have difficulty forgiving the shortcomings of others Interestingly when popular author Brené Brown had to come up with a title for her book about wholehearted living she chose to call it The Gifts of Imperfection gifts with the subtitle Let Go of Who You Think You re Supposed to Be and Embrace Who You Are And so this too is part of our reason for a belief in imperfection if we humans are constantly trying to live up to some theoretical ideal then it will be hard for us to fully discover and accept our deeper and more authentic natures principles https www Practopian org core principles html balance https www Practopian org tags balance html connect https www Practopian org tags connection html diversity https www Practopian org tags diversity html equality https www Practopian org tags equality html integral https www Practopian org tags integral html gifts https amzn to 2OGgtL2 jeduf https www softdevbigideas com just enough design up front html ci https www industryweek com companies amp executives continuous improvement perfect enemy good enemy https en wikipedia org wiki Perfect is the enemy of good imperfection tags imperfection html"

		title: "The Importance of Mission",

    url: "blog/hbowie/the-importance-of-mission.html",
		content: "The dictionary on my Mac defines mission as a strongly felt aim ambition or calling Implicit in this definition is the idea that we are talking about something other than simple self interest We are all motivated to take care of ourselves but a mission implies something greater an impulse to contribute to something larger than our individual existence A prerequisite for a mission is a surplus of resources something more than what is needed for simple subsistence If we are just scraping by then no mission no matter how keenly felt will get much traction We may tell ourselves that there is not really any surplus available but in fact nothing resembling modern human society could exist for long without a surplus If we were all busy every waking hour producing the bare necessities of existence for immediate consumption then there would be no surplus to talk about But in fact many of us do generally have surpluses of time material resources and or capital and so what we do with that extra bit is done by choice at one level or another and the missions that we pursue both individually and collectively help determine what choices we end up making For organizations the type of mission pursued will often depend to some degree on the form that the enterprise takes A nonprofit organization npo NPO is typically formed exclusively for the purpose of pursuing a mission of one sort or another A benefit corporation bcorp sometimes called a B corp is a relatively new sort of for profit entity The exact definition varies somewhat from one state to another in the US but in general it is a corporation with owners and profits but also with a stated goal of delivering benefits to society the community workers and or the environment Traditional C Corporations ccorp are often held to have a primary or even exclusive focus on delivering financial benefits to their shareholders thus providing the impetus for defining Benefit Corporations to specifically have broader goals We should carefully consider the missions for all of the organizations that we interact with in one way or another Many capitalists today seem to think that making as much money as possible is their only mission and that to succeed at this goal entitles them to a moral high ground as well as an economic one In a similar vein many consumers seem to be on a mission to buy as much as possible for as little as possible feeling a comparable degree of rectitude for these endeavors But whether you are trying to maximize your revenue your market share your growth rate or your profits achieving your financial goals does not guarantee that you are also having a positive impact on society and there are always multiple viable pathways for making money As Steve Jobs once famously said to John Sculley when convincing him to leave Pepsi and become CEO at Apple > Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world Of course if we re looking for a positive mission in the tech world of today we might be better off considering the work of Jimmy Wales and Wikipedia in the nonprofit sector > Wales understood the web s egalitarian underpinning and the open source method s ability to spur productivity on a grand scale What separated him from many first wave net entrepreneurs though was his idealism He harnessed those forces in the service of social good He recognized the incalculable value of offering the entire human store of knowledge to anyone anywhere at no cost and he made it his job to get it done > > Ted Greenwald writing for Wired in the article How Jimmy Wales Wikipedia Harnessed the Web as a Force for Good wired In terms of a sense of personal mission one could certainly do worse than to follow the path described by Albert Einstein in his book The World As I See It Albert > How strange is the lot of us mortals Each of us is here for a brief sojourn for what purpose he knows not though he sometimes thinks he senses it But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people first of all for those upon whose smiles and well being our own happiness is wholly dependent and then for the many unknown to us to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men and women living and dead and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving Albert https amzn to 2vyCRvf bcorp https en wikipedia org wiki Benefit corporation bigbus what to do about big business html ccorp https en wikipedia org wiki C corporation marval https en wikipedia org wiki List of public corporations by market capitalization 2018 mission core mission html npo https en wikipedia org wiki Nonprofit organization wired https www wired com 2013 03 jimmy wales wikipedia"

		content: "It was just a little over four years ago that I remember sitting in front of our TV with our neighbors watching the election returns preparing to celebrate I think it was the New York Times website that I had open on my iPad showing a dynamic chart tracking the projected probability of victory for each presidential candidate And then within what seemed like only a few minutes those two lines one red one blue changed direction crossed one another and reversed positions So much for the value of political prognostication It was a month or two after that when our son sent us an email with a link to a Google doc that was publicly available I followed the link and it looked interesting It was a little treatise describing practical ways for citizens to influence their elected representatives guide A month or two later I had the good fortune to hear one of the authors ezra of that document in person speaking here in Seattle to a crowd of about 1 000 people gathered downtown in our venerable Town Hall th His appearance had been hastily arranged by a local political player who had met him just a few days earlier at a party in San Francisco and persuaded him to make a quick detour to Seattle to speak to a small group here I don t remember much of what he said that night save for one memorable detail He said that after the surprising popularity of their little Google doc he and his partner were forming a modest organization indiv and they would be emailing us from time to time but would never ask us for money A couple of years later when both founders were appearing in Seattle this time to promote their new book book I had a chance to ask his partner leah as she was signing my copy what she now thought of that statement I can t recall her exact words but it was something like Well that wasn t very realistic And now here we all are after an amazing Democratic trifecta tri in DC with our new president off to what seems like an astonishingly effective and progressive start klein to his first term So what remains to be done Everything I am gratified and amazed when one of my stories takes off on Medium I m like a kid in a candy store checking my stats every few minutes and then happily announcing to all who will listen primarily my wife and my dog who are both incredibly tolerant Can you believe it the numbers are still going up I ve published 66 essays aka stories on Medium over the past couple of years but two of them have been read and applauded more than all the others combined The first was Why a Centrist Candidate Won t Win the Presidency centrist originally titled Is There Any Middle Left prior to editing and then much more recently The Decline of the Republican Party First Gradually and then Suddenly decline And I m delighted with the numbers of people who have read and shown their appreciation for both of these At the same time however I m aware that both of these pieces although they were not intended this way might be viewed as a species of progressive wish fulfillment as a sort of soothing balm that might lull liberal fantasists into sweet and soothing dreams of our rosy futures together Which brings me to this piece which I offer as a sort of bracing corrective First let me say clearly that without the untiring work of progressive activists all across our country over the last few years we might all be sitting here today wondering how Trump could have been elected to a second term or wondering how Biden could possibly get anything done with the Republicans still in control of the Senate or worst of all wondering what to do after Trump and his minions had successfully manipulated the reporting of election results in order to keep their leader in office for another four years What actually happened instead of these alternative outcomes was not due to an unstoppable wave of progressive sentiment sweeping across our nation No it happened because leaders stepped up and dedicated themselves to the cause of progress and because volunteers stepped up to help in any way they could by writing letters to their representatives by writing letters to prospective voters by sending text messages and making phone calls to strangers and yes even by responding to emails asking for financial donations But none of our recent gains are secure There are more elections coming more votes to be counted more roll calls to be taken And if we ve learned anything about our American political process over the past several years we have learned that elections are often decided by razor thin margins that the all important swing voters often make decisions that cannot be explained by entirely rational means and that for various odd and sometimes nefarious reasons enjoying a popular majority is not always enough to win you an election or a critical vote in our legislatures But there s one more thing I ve come to realize I ve learned that progress and prosperity and peace and justice can never be taken for granted but always require always have required always will require ongoing effort Here s the way Albert Einstein put it when addressing the Chicago Decalogue Society back in 1954 > The existence and validity of human rights are not written in the stars The ideals concerning the conduct of men toward each other and the desirable structure of the community have been conceived and taught by enlightened individuals in the course of history Those ideals and convictions which resulted from historical experience from the craving for beauty and harmony have been readily accepted in theory by man and at all times have been trampled upon by the same people under the pressure of their animal instincts A large part of history is therefore replete with the struggle for those human rights an eternal struggle in which a final victory can never be won But to tire in that struggle would mean the ruin of society There is always more to be done More education More reaching out More discussions with strangers More work More growth More action But none of this should be disappointing to us or disheartening The good news is that we all have a chance to make a difference and that this opportunity is always in front of us and that the work when undertaken with others of like minds and open hearts is its own reward And so just two more things before I surrender the pulpit for today a request and a pledge First the pledge I will donate my Medium earnings from this piece as well as my prior one you know that really popular one to the Indivisible organization indiv Next the request never become complacent and continue to strive for progress contributing in whatever way you can There is always more to be done and a host of progressive organizations around eager to welcome

to make a buying decision For portable devices we d all like the battery to last a week without needing to be charged but if that means we ll need a cart to roll the battery around then we will have gone too far in one direction hence the importance of balance Unfortunately as important as it is balance often has three strikes against it 1 Balance can be really hard Whether we re talking about a seesaw the scales of justice or a house of cards it s usually a lot easier to tip things over in one direction than it is to find and maintain a stable balance between opposing forces 2 From a spectator s perspective balance is usually boring because it lacks the drama of swinging from one extreme to another 3 Balance can be hard to defend Those who speak in its favor can be easily accused of being inconsistent wishy washy weak willed or fuzzy minded or all four at once on a particularly bad day Sadly for all of us I think the cause of balance has fallen on hard times of late All three of the factors working against it seem to be operating in full force on a daily basis no matter where we look Donors and sponsors demand unwavering allegiance to one fundamentalist extreme or the other whether it s free market capitalism or the right to bear arms News media of all stripes and persuasions realize that balance doesn t sell newspapers or capture eyeballs and so we are subjected to a constant barrage of one extreme or another no matter which channel we turn to And the same people who insisted for years on a repeal of ObamaCare it turns out have no idea in their simple heads about what would constitute a suitable replacement And so we find ourselves in times where it is seemingly impossible to get elected without going to one extreme or the other even though paradoxically it is also impossible to actually govern without striking an appropriate balance between these same extremes Hopefully our politicians will figure this out before long Right now they mostly don t seem to get it The most recent elections in Great Britain british elections are a good example Because as it turns out even though a majority of the voters may plop down one way or the other in any particular election that doesn t mean that as a whole they want a sharp turn in the course of their affairs They re just trying to shift the balance in one direction or the other So as soon as the most recent victors start to act as if they had a mandate for radical change they find their electorate is now pushing in the other direction seeking once again to achieve that elusive balance Sooner rather than later one hopes they will realize there is a sound reason why the adjective unbalanced is generally a pejorative to be avoided Because as Barry Goldwater discovered even though extremism in defense of liberty may not be categorized as a vice neither is it a reliable way to get elected goldwater The American founding fathers of course were great believers in balance This is why they cunningly fashioned a balance of power between the executive judicial and legislative branches between the federal government and the states between the House of Representatives and the Senate between the powers of government and the rights of individuals Such a delicate balance was not easy to work out At one point in fact Benjamin Franklin exclaimed that Every Body cries a Union is absolutely necessary but when they come to the Manner and Form of the Union their weak Noddles are perfectly distracted But we all benefit daily from this democratic house of cards that they were ultimately able to contrive and which we so far have been able to keep standing So what can we do to bring the value of balance back to the forefront of our shared consciousness Just this speak up for it defend it demand it from our reporters and our leaders cultivate it every chance we get And remember always that this need to speak out in defense of balance is nothing new After all Irish poet William Butler Yeats wrote nearly a century ago yeats > Turning and turning in the widening gyre > The falcon cannot hear the falconer > Things fall apart the centre cannot hold > The best lack all conviction while the worst > Are full of passionate intensity But although the structure seems to waver at times it has not yet collapsed and the centre is still there waiting for us to make our way back to it All it takes are valiant men and women speaking out for it doing the hard but rewarding work necessary to find it in every sphere of our lives Nothing less is acceptable Because in the end nothing of lasting

		title: "An Integral Approach",
		date: "26 Oct 2018",
    url: "blog/hbowie/an-integral-approach.html",
		content: " Integral Basics At its most basic taking an integral approach simply means that people can see things from different perspectives and that often no one way of seeing something is the right or only way As just one example if we look at the issue of laws concerning guns guns it s easy to find at least two different viewpoints We can view the issue from the perspective of a possible infringement of civil liberties We can look at it from the viewpoint of minimizing harm to innocent people To take an integral approach is to admit that neither of these perspectives is right or wrong but that instead they are different but both valid ways of looking at the same situation This sort of approach doesn t prevent us from making decisions or taking action but it can result in longer periods of uncertainty less confidence in decisions and a more difficult decision making process On the other side of the equation though an integral approach can result in more effective decisions and in an easier path to improving those decisions when new evidence is brought to light Here s the way Jason Fried put it when summarizing advice received from Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos bezos > He s observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding reconsidering a problem they thought they d already solved They re open to new points of view new information new ideas contradictions and challenges to their own way of thinking > > This doesn t mean you shouldn t have a well formed point of view but it means you should consider your point of view as temporary > > What trait signified someone who was wrong a lot of the time Someone obsessed with details that only support one point of view If someone can t climb out of the details and see the bigger picture from multiple angles they re often wrong most of the time Advanced Integral Inner vs Outer Individual vs Group Going beyond the basics we will often find it helpful to consider different categories of perspectives that have been devised by big picture philosophers and historians such as Ken Wilber and Yuval Noah Harari For our purposes in this section today let s consider three such categories using terminology from Harari An objective perspective views phenomena from an exterior vantage point without consideration for inner feelings or thoughts For example an objective summary of the Great Migration gm northward of African Americans in the early part of the 20th century might use a chart showing how many people moved during which decade and how many moved to each major city A subjective perspective considers only the feelings and thoughts of a single individual So a diary of one participant in the Great Migration might reveal the innermost thoughts and feelings of that one person An inter subjective perspective arises from communications linking and expressing the subjective thoughts and feelings shared by a group of individuals So articles from the black press of the day might offer such an inter subjective perspective on the Great Migration And of course a work of art such as The Migration Series migr by Jacob Lawrence can help us understand all three types of perspectives For current examples think about Amazon s recent decision to raise the minimum wage for its employees to $15 hour or the issue of homelessness in cities such as Seattle and San Francisco A moment s thought should convince you that it would be hard to form a complete picture of either situation without considering subjective objective and inter subjective perspectives For a deeper dive on these perspectives see The Four Quadrants of Human Knowledge 4q Advanced Integral Stages of Development Big thinkers such as Wilber Harari Clare Graves Don Beck and Chris Cowan have one more integral tool to add to our thinking toolbox and that s the notion that we can perceive a situation through the lenses of various stages of development We might characterize these stages or levels in the following way 1 Archaic Instinctual Focused on immediate survival needs behavior based on inborn instincts and reflexes 2 Magical animistic Seeing various objects and aspects of the world as separate entities each with their own independent natures but without any deep or accurate understanding 3 Tribal Power Gods Assertion of self for dominance and power organization into tribes tribal structures based on power hierarchies might makes right 4 Traditional Mythic Order organization around shared laws and principles that have been handed down from elders belief in the law and in an authoritarian hierarchy from which the law is passed down 5 Modern Rational Beliefs derived and enhanced through application of the scientific method through shared accumulated and jointly tested knowledge 6 Postmodern Pluralistic Egalitarian relativistic situational accepting of fluid affiliations consensus based decision making conscious and active acceptance of varying ethnic backgrounds and traditions In order to understand what to make of these different levels of development it s important to keep the following points in mind We can apply these levels both to the development of individuals as well as to the development of our societies Each level can also be thought of differently depending on whether we are taking a subjective objective or inter subjective viewpoint As one example the way it feels to belong to a tribe is something different from the organizational techniques used by a tribe in order to achieve its shared goals Although we can think of this succession of levels as a sort of developmental ladder on which we climb it would be a mistake to think that the achievement of a new higher rung implies the abandonment or obsolescence of prior lower levels In truth each new level just adds some new tools to our toolbox but they don t prevent the continued operation of the other lower levels It s probably best to think of all these levels functioning in parallel both within our individual selves and within our societies For a deeper dive on these perspectives see Developmental Levels dl and Developmental Levels as Evolving Social Structures ss Summary and Sample Application In politics the left generally lays claim to levels 5 and 6 while those on the right operate more intensively at levels 3 and 4 It s also generally true that liberals tend to focus more explicitly on subjective experiences hence their reputations as bleeding hearts while conservatives tend to emphasize objective perceptions often taking the exterior view and showing a reluctance to discuss inner states On the other hand in recent years conservatives have arguably become more adept at using all of these perspectives and levels to motivate voters while liberals have often remained stubbornly stuck in their traditional comfort zones This tends to be why those on the right tend to think of liberals as displaying excessive political correctness since they seem reluctant to ever admit the existence or relevance of lower developmental levels It s probably worth noting that any politician is likely to be more successful if he or she is attuned to the multiple perspectives at work in their electorate Successful modern businesses generally make use of all of these different perspectives in order to survive and prosper in the marketplace We human beings are marvelously complex beings and are constantly doing things that surprise delight and sometimes terrify the rest of us Taking an integral perspective though can help us all better understand ourselves and others around us

		title: "The Issues Swirling around Spotify and its Content Providers",
		date: "09 Feb 2022",
    url: "blog/hbowie/the-issues-swirling-around-spotify-and-its-content-providers.html",
		content: "You ve probably heard a bit in the news lately spotcon about Spotify Neil Young Joe Rogan and Brené Brown But what are the real issues at stake in this evolving controversy Censorship Greed Free Speech Big Tech Let me break it down for you Free Speech vs Censorship Even though people keep talking about free speech and censorship I m not sure this is really much of an issue in the current situation It s true that Spotify has recently taken down some of Rogan s episodes after some objectionable content was pointed out to them but this is a bit like closing the proverbial barn door after the stallion has bolted Rogan is in no danger of losing his platform or his audience So there s really not much to see here Money Money of course is at the very heart of these controversies And there s nothing wrong with making a bit of money The questions as always are what else one has to sacrifice to make more of the moolah and how much is enough Business Models There are many ways to monetize content and each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages Open Access vs Lock In The point of open access is to allow anyone access to content in which they are interested and to allow them to freely decide how they access that content The point of lock in is to restrict content access forcing consumers to accept some restrictions if they want access to particular content In a way these issues mirror those of free speech but from the point of view of listeners rather than speakers whereas free speech is about removing restrictions for speakers open access is about removing restrictions for listeners It seems a bit hypocritical to me to speak out with great passion for free speech while at the same time acting to restrict open access Mission Whether we re talking about people or organizations it s always relevant to ask what missions they espouse and to what degrees they are living up to those missions Activity without any sense of mission is not likely to accomplish much of interest other than transferring money from your pockets to mine or vice versa Freedom of and Importance of Association The signers of the American Declaration of Independence famously stated We Mutually Pledge To Each Other Our Lives Our Fortunes And Our Sacred Honor These were people who appreciated the freedom to choose their associates but also the importance of those associations and the levels of commitment they were willing to make to defend those choices Freedom of Association https en wikipedia org wiki Freedom of association is not much discussed as part of this controversy but I believe it lies at the very center of it The Players Now that we ve identified the issues at play let me talk a bit about the people involved and their actions Spotify Spotify s approach to podcasting has been one of lock in signing up podcasters with large audiences to long term exclusive deals If you want to hear Joe Rogan then you can only do that on Spotify If you want to listen to Brené Brown then you can only do that on Spotify And if you want to listen to either on a Mac then you will be led to download the Spotify app from their website and said app will sneakily re launch itself every time you start up your computer unless you can find the option to disable that behavior which is tucked away in the app s Advanced Settings And if you fail to upgrade your membership you will be shown ads even when you are trying to adjust the app s preferences And while you may not be familiar with Joe Rogan and or Brené Brown one interesting point is that they both have large and faithful followings and their audience demographics are pretty much mirror images of each other And so for a company to pursue both of these content providers with equal ardor says only one thing they are out to corner the market by appealing to as many different cohorts as possible with no real interest in the nature of the content being provided And as to the company s mission When searching for such a beast I came across a recent piece from The Verge titled Spotify s CEO mistakes company growth for a mission statement https www theverge com 2022 2 8 22923525 spotify daniel ek mission statement talent recruitment Not sure I can add much to that so let s just move on shall we Joe Rogan I have never heard Joe Rogan and am not likely to ever listen to him for many reasons So there s not really much I can say about him Neil Young I ve been listening to Neil Young for over fifty years and know him as a principled artist who is no stranger to battle lines being drawn and to choosing sides I heard him perform at a coffee house in Ann Arbor in 1969 and then later in the same academic year listened to his anthem Ohio being played on the radio just a few weeks after National Guard officers had shot and killed four Kent State students who had been protesting against the Vietnam War > Tin soldiers and Nixon coming > We re finally on our own > This summer I hear the drumming > Four dead in Ohio > > Gotta get down to it > Soldiers are cutting us down > Should have been done long ago > What if you knew her > And found her dead on the ground > How can you run when you know And if you really want to talk about free speech and censorship this song was banned from many AM stations when it was released because of the way it directly called out our sitting US president So when Neil Young and his record company announced that his music would no longer be available on Spotify Young was exercising his freedom of association he gets to choose with whom he associates and he no longer wanted to be associated with Joe Rogan And by emphasizing the power of his choice he made it clear that others content providers and listeners also had a choice He was underscoring the power of choice and the freedom to choose for himself and for others Brené Brown You may not be familiar with Brown She is an American research professor lecturer author and podcast host known in particular for her research on shame vulnerability and leadership Some of her book titles are Daring Greatly Braving the Wilderness and Dare to Lead some or all of which might seem a little ironic in view of where she has landed in this current podcasting controversy I m familiar with some of Brown s stuff and while I wouldn t necessarily call myself a fan I appreciate and support her work Brown is one of those content providers who has found herself caught on the horns of a dilemma following Neil Young s refusal to be associated with Spotify and Joe Rogan And yes I was aware that Brown teaches at the University of Texas when I chose that analogy Let s just run down the list of issues I identified above shall we and see where she stands on each As I go down the list I will at times be referring to her latest pronouncement on the subject which you can find here https brenebrown com articles 2022 02 08 podcast update february 8 2022 Free Speech vs Censorship Brown clearly comes down on the side of free speech As I said above I think this is a bit of a red herring in this case but take it for what it s worth Money I m confident in assuming that Brown chose to maximize her income by choosing to sign a multiyear exclusive contract with Spotify This is a topic she dances around but never seems to directly address Business Models By signing an exclusive contract with Spotify Brown chose to make money by deputizing a third party to monetize her followers ears in any way they liked through paid subscriptions if possible and through advertising if not She also delegated the choice of advertisers to this same third party with a few exclusions in place to ensure that her listeners didn t hear some of the same ads that Rogan s was hearing By choosing this model she placed herself at a comfortable remove from the dirty business of actually collecting money and hawking products while still presumably cashing her monthly checks Open Access vs Lock In Brown started out giving listeners open access to her work and then decided on lock in once she chose to sign with Spotify This was a decision that seemed to me to be at odds with her espoused values long before the recent controversy emerged Freedom of Association Brown freely chose to associate herself with Spotify apparently without giving much thought to who else she might be associated with as a result of that decision She freely chose to sign a multi year exclusive contract with Spotify When she was in a position to freely choose the podcast sponsors she was willing to be associated with she found that association to be distasteful and decided instead to disassociate herself from her show s sponsors while still making money from them Mission Brown has a long and meandering Belonging Statement https brenebrown com bbearg belonging statement but no concise mission statement The most prominent part of her Belonging Statement says that > We are called to > > + Be brave > + Serve the work > + Take good care > + Cultivate belonging > + Create beauty and excellence in all things So when Brown signed her multiyear exclusive contract with Spotify was she really being brave Serving the work Taking good care Cultivating belonging And creating beauty and excellence neither of which can reliably be found in Spotify s apps business practices or ad placement As Brown confessed in her most recent post If you want to sit with me and talk you need to come to my table And I m sitting with Joe Rogan But sharing the table with Rogan puts me in a tremendous values conflict with very few options I think that s an accurate picture of the corner that Brown has painted herself into One can only wish that she had noticed how the paint was being applied a little earlier in the process And As For Me I ll still be listening to Neil Young https music apple com us artist neil young 147370 playing at the highest sound fidelity I can find I won t be listening to Brown s podcasts or using Spotify to listen to anyone or anything I ll still be listening to podcasters willing to openly speak the names of their shows sponsors I ll still be respecting those who are willing to draw hard and fast lines and willing to take a stand And I will continue to try to choose my associates with care spotcon https www nytimes com 2022 02 09 arts

		title: "Is There Any Middle Left",

    url: "blog/hbowie/is-there-any-middle-left.html",
		content: "As the US political scene transitions from the Democratic successes in the midterms to the beginnings of the 2020 presidential contest one of the most pressing questions to emerge is whether there is any meaningful middle ground remaining along the political spectrum stretching from left to right This will certainly be a question for Democrats to consider in their primaries but the concern has also come to the fore as a result of Starbucks founder Howard Schultz announcing his availability to run for president as a centrist independent schultz And so we have to ask exactly what would an avowed centrist believe in these days One of the traditional recipes for a centrist is to call oneself a social liberal and a fiscal conservative But where does this leave you You don t gain any libertarian votes because you believe in moderate gun control and some reasonable degree of federal taxation You lose the religious right because you believe in a woman s right to abortion and in LGBTQ rights You lose the mostly older mostly pale mostly male voters who are obsessed with sending all the immigrants back to wherever they came from and slapping up a wall right behind them just as soon as you get them across the border Ergo you give up all hope of support from Fox News and the right wing media But that s ok right You re a centrist so you re trying to position yourself to the left of those nutjobs So now let s turn our attention to those extremists on the other end of the spectrum that you re trying to distance yourself from You lose those on the left who believe that global climate change climate is a serious issue that demands national focus and investment and something more than lip service You lose those on the left who believe that social justice is tied to our growing income inequality inequality and that to address both we need to change our laws and tax policies to better provide for workers and children and consumers and make things a bit less cushy for rich people And so who do you have left Those who somehow don t think we need to Make America Great Again but who do believe that all we need is a sort of Return to Normalcy after the great aberration of the Trump Presidency Those who are worried about saddling the next generation with an astronomical national debt debt but not worried about leaving them with a hotter planet and nowhere they can afford to live And what is your rallying cry What are your hot button issues to motivate your base Balancing the budget Most of us think that this is important but very few of us believe these days that this issue is anywhere near the top of our list of concerns The chief political strategy of both sides in recent years has been demonization of its opponents What do you do as a centrist try to convincingly demonize those on both the right and the left Fight a political war on two fronts at the same time Hand out hats in a calming color that say Make America Normal Again or Back to Center My sense is that the chief voting bloc for centrism consists of business owners executives and middle managers and professionals people who feel they re doing pretty well and just want to avoid rocking the boat those in the 9 9 percent who make up Matthew Stewart s New American Aristocracy stewart But even if you can somehow motivate all of these people to come out and vote for you that s not a big enough group to support a successful presidential run The basic problem for a centrist I think is that hardly anyone today thinks that these are normal times that call for a normal leader There is seemingly a large group of Americans who think that abortion birth control homosexuality criminals Muslims and people of color are ruining our nation They fear nothing more than a normal leader who would let all those forces proceed unchecked There is another large group of Americans who believe that climate change is real and that we need to do something about it before it goes any farther They fear nothing more than a normal leader who would fiddle while the world burns There is another bunch of us who believe that rising levels of income and wealth inequality are not only dangerous and unpleasant for a great many Americans but also threaten the very integrity of our social order This group wants nothing to do with a centrist leader who would allow these disturbing economic trends to continue apace And there is another no doubt overlapping contingent with the belief that our society lacks all sense of social justice with open season seemingly having been declared on people of color gays and non Christians This group certainly wants nothing to do with a centrist leader who thinks there is some normal American condition that is worth returning to In short some of us want to return again to where we ve been in the past while some want to venture to someplace we have not yet been But hardly anyone just wants to stay where we are or even where we were four years ago I think most of us have some idea of what a right wing worldview looks like these days we may not agree with it but it s well established and we know what it looks like And most of us have some idea of what a progressive worldview looks like again we may not agree with it but we understand how the world appears from this perspective But how does the world currently appear through the eyes of a centrist Is there some way to just split the difference between the far right and the far left and call it good I think most of us don t have any clue about how to do this Try as hard as we can we can t quite figure out what the world looks like through a centrist lens And so what does that leave us with for an image of such a leader The only thing I can conjure up is a picture of a jet ski that has lost its rider quietly turning in circles to avoid doing any damage And that s not an inspiring picture for a presidential candidate climate https www cbsnews com news

		title: "Kindness by Design",

    url: "blog/hbowie/kindness-by-design.html",
		content: "Sometimes I find myself making good headway through a book only to be suddenly stopped in my tracks by a particular insight that suggests an entirely new way of thinking about a problem And then on certain inspired occasions I find my thoughts ricocheting from one such idea to another something like one of those steel balls bouncing around in a pinball machine darting back and forth to ever greater heights I came across one such passage recently in Kate Raworth s excellent 2017 book Doughnut Economics 7 Ways to Think Like a 21st Century Economist raworth There it was staring up at me from page 180 > Economics it turns out is not a matter of discovering laws it is essentially a question of design What a novel seemingly radical notion And yet once considered it makes perfect sense We know that the many strange and complex ways in which we humans create value for ourselves and others didn t just spring up one day they weren t discovered full blown created according to some natural laws no they ve been conceived and fashioned by humans in accordance with our sundry motivations values and notions And then another quote came to mind this one from Steve Jobs jobs > When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world Try not to bash into the walls too much Try to have a nice family have fun save a little money > > That s a very limited life Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it you can influence it you can build your own things that other people can use And of course Steve s idea amplifies Kate s When we humans are first starting out we are entirely focused on learning the way things are but then if we take the next step we learn that we can change things we can make them better we can build things that other people can use even new economies And then in another excellent book Michael E McCullough s The Kindness of Strangers How a Selfish Ape Invented a New Moral Code mcc I came across this passage > Concern for the entire world How exactly are you supposed to pull that off Each Axial Age society came up with its own approach The Hebrew scriptures of Second Temple Judaism for instance directed the wealthy to set aside some of their crops for the poor They also called for the cancellation of onerous debts and the restoration of land to its original owners during the Jubilee year every fiftieth year And the Jubilee reference then brought to mind the Robert Hunter lyrics lyrics to the song Sugaree which I had first heard performed by Jackie Greene greene > Shake it up now Sugaree > I ll meet you at the Jubilee > And if that Jubilee don t come > Baby I ll meet you on the run But how is this idea of a Jubilee year connected to the original thought by Kate Just in this way writing a law calling for the cancellation of onerous debts and the restoration of land to its original owners in every fiftieth year is very plainly an act of design It s not something that just happened or a law that was discovered it was a law that was written And while this idea of a Jubilee every twenty five or fifty years may at first glance seem rather odd and arbitrary we can see a certain sense to it even from our vantage point in 2021 After all as recently as 2013 economist Thomas Piketty pik undertook an extensive analysis that basically confirmed the conventional wisdom that if capitalism is left to its own devices then over time the rich get richer and the poor get poorer rich And while capitalists may regard this tendency as only right and fair and the natural result of a sort of economic meritocracy a few problems arise + If this tendency is allowed to proceed without intervention then eventually a few will have everything and most will have nothing + While one can make an argument for allowing economic competition between individuals to reward some more than others if society allows the resulting wealth to be passed down from one generation to the next within families then the playing field for individuals is no longer level since some individuals now start their competitions considerably ahead of others see the antics of Donald Trump and his offspring trump for anecdotal confirmation of the problems with this approach + Even if we conceive of our modern economies as games in some sense with individual players competing to maximize their winnings we must concede that all games have to start over at some point for a few reasons 1 first because when some players get so far ahead of the others it makes no sense to continue the competition 2 second starting over gives all players a new chance to compete on a level playing field and 3 third starting over gives all players a chance to apply what they ve learned from past wins and losses to a fresh competition Even the NFL has to give losing teams the top draft picks nfl in order to keep the playing field reasonably level And so we see that in our American economy we seem to go through cycles of wealth accumulation leading up to a gilded age gilded followed by some rectifying progressive action prog that restores a decent degree of wealth to the middle class In other words we have our own sort of jubilee every fifty years or so we just don t seem to be smart enough to recognize it as such and institutionalize it So perhaps we might come around to thinking that economic kindness instead of being something indulged in capriciously by bleeding heart liberals who are occasionally feeling generous should in fact be a regular practice that is designed into our societies Then perhaps more of us might manage to avoid the fate prescribed by G K Chesterton gk to those too focused on the singular goal of amassing wealth > Among the rich you will never find a really generous man even by accident They may give their money away but they will never give themselves away they are egotistic secretive dry as old bones To be smart enough to get all that money you must be dull enough to want it gilded https en wikipedia org wiki Gilded Age

		content: "I was reading recently about a couple of different situations involving traits of both leadership and followership First there was the statement by Liz Cheney cheney that The 2020 presidential election was not stolen contradicting recent statements from Donald Trump setting up a battle for Republican Party leadership and prompting a Tweet from Rep John Rutherford R Fla asserting that Liz Cheney does not understand the responsibilities of leadership Then there was the brouhaha at and around Basecamp following some controversial leadership decisions basecamp announced by the founders including no more societal and political discussions on our company Basecamp account and no more committees Some reflection on these two situations has compelled me to dispense the following bits of wisdom on the subjects of leading and following Some of these may seem obvious and some controversial but they are all equally true and valuable based on my own experience doing a fair bit of both in a number of different organizations 1 Leadership consists primarily of making decisions and communicating those decisions 2 Followership consists primarily of accepting and implementing decisions 3 To live in human society almost always involves more following than leading even for anointed leaders 4 Much of what we call management within an organization involves a combination of leading and following each leader must follow direction from other leaders who are operating within their areas of authority at the same time they must understand and internalize such direction and tailor the implementation and communication details of such direction as appropriate for usage by their own teams 5 Both leadership and followership are primarily forward looking affairs neither leaders nor followers can afford to dwell for long on past failures or successes 6 The best way to ensure that nothing will ever get done is to wait for a perfect decision 7 Even though no decision is perfect some decisions are vastly better than others 8 Facts matter You can make decisions based on untruths and you can persuade followers to accept those decisions for some periods of time but sooner or later such decisions will come back to bite you 9 The obvious choices are not always the best ones The most important decisions often require hard choices involving significant tradeoffs 10 We are all individuals and we are all different but each of us should have some degree of integrity about what we believe how we make our beliefs known to others and how we act in accordance with those beliefs 11 We live in a multi tribal society that is each of us belongs to more than one tribe we have some degree of choice in terms of where we place our allegiances and each tribe has its own goals and rules Not all actions no matter how well intentioned are appropriate at all times within all tribes 12 We all get to decide when to lead and when to follow 13 We all get to decide who to follow and how to lead 14 We are all responsible for our own decisions 15 Decisions have consequences and sometimes those consequences may include a parting of ways with others 16 We each may place differing degrees of trust in various leaders but no leader is infallible and the leaders who least deserve our trust are those who claim infallibility 17 Effective leaders often defer decisions while more relevant information is being collected 18 Effective leaders recognize that there always comes a time when the negative consequences of failing to decide begin to outweigh the risks associated with making a decision 19 The primary purpose of a committee is to dilute or deflect responsibility for announced decisions or to misdirect attention away from which decisions are the important ones and who is making them 20 Quests for consensus sometimes work when the group size is no more than four and when all members of the group already know and respect one another In any other situation quests for consensus generally result in a masking of differences rather than true agreement 21 The best leaders seek counsel from others and sometimes delegate decision making authority to others but generally reserve the authority to make a final decision when + The decision has significant consequences + The decision making power lies within the leader s authority + The leader feels sufficiently well informed and + The leader has a strong opinion on the issues at hand Note that the four conditions above are joined by an and if any of them are missing then it may be best for the leader to defer to others I will leave the application of these observations to the two situations mentioned earlier as an exercise for the reader basecamp https world hey com jason changes at basecamp 7f32afc5 cheney https www washingtonpost com politics cheney trump election mccarthy 2021 05 03 41ca672c ac21 11eb ab4c 986555a1c511 story html followership https iveybusinessjournal com publication followership the other side of leadership"

		title: "Lessons to be Learned from the Fall of Afghanistan",
		date: "17 Aug 2021",
    url: "blog/hbowie/lessons-to-be-learned-from-the-fall-of-afghanistan.html",
		content: "I think there are a few very broad lessons we Americans can learn from the rapid fall of the Afghan government over the last few days 1 Any enterprise is in trouble when it is not informed by the boots on the ground The view from those doing the work on the ground is necessarily different from the more lofty view of those in charge But when an enterprise is working well there are ways for the working level view of reality to be taken into account by those at the top From what I ve been able to glean it was not any great surprise to many members of the American military who had served over there to see how quickly the Afghan army faded away I imagine that Biden was well informed on this point and was not under any illusion that the outcome would be materially different from what we have seen play out in recent days 2 Our American society is more complex and multi faceted than any of us can know We all have our parts to play and we all know a bit about our parts and a few others But if any of us thinks we know enough about our own society and all its complex workings to be able to help create something akin to it in a foreign country we are just kidding ourselves There are far too many moving parts that interact with each other in myriad complex ways Any society has to evolve organically We can perhaps influence its growth in some ways but even then the outcomes are often different from our intentions Democracy is a wonderful thing but as the last several years have shown us it s hard enough to keep one functioning in our own country let alone trying to set one up somewhere else 3 Cultural evolution takes time We are often tripped up in our modern world because we have different sorts of things happening at such different speeds + Digital communication is practically instantaneous + International travel and transport can happen in a matter of hours + The acquisition of almost any sort of material consumer goods can be completed within a few hours a couple of days at the most + Advances in technology come along every year if not every month and entire markets can be upended within a decade + And yet sociocultural evolution outside of the realm of technology takes generations We would do well to remember the words of John Adams a founding father and our second US president who observed > I must study politics and war that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy geography natural history and naval architecture navigation commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting poetry music architecture statuary tapestry and porcelain One cannot help but feel that the Taliban were adeptly studying politics and war while those in charge of the recently fallen Afghan government were perhaps studying more advanced topics before having mastered the basics 4 We can t dismiss power pyramids In any human society power is built and wielded through hierarchical organizations Such organizations are built around trust and competence and tradition and loyalty to colleagues and to leaders It has become fashionable to label these sorts of organizational models as command and control and to dismiss them as being old fashioned giving way to more egalitarian structures But this is a dangerous illusion The way that these hierarchies are structured will necessarily evolve and change over time But no amount of warm egalitarian sentiment will remove the necessity for their existence There are many different interests loose in the world today all grappling for power One may wish to see such power distributed equally among all of our world citizens but there are two unavoidable realities that we must keep in mind + Humans find ways to band together in order to accomplish ambitious goals + Such bands of humans compete with each other for access to valuable and scarce resources These same conditions are true for companies as well as for nations Human rights are wonderful things but they can only be granted alongside a balancing set of responsibilities within an overarching hierarchy holding enough power to maintain an orderly access to necessary resources Such rights can t simply be wished into existence even when they are committed to paper Bottom Line These are important lessons that apply to our efforts to improve other countries but they apply equally to our efforts to improve our own country our own companies and our own organizations 1 The realities available to those attempting the actual work must make their way to leadership and leadership must not turn a blind eye to these observations 2 Modern societies established within nations and within other sorts of organizations are almost unfathomably complex and must grow and adapt organically 3 Sociocultural evolution happens over generations if it appears to be happening more rapidly then it is probably being faked 4 Power hierarchies can be used for good or for evil for liberation or oppression but they cannot simply be dismissed as irrelevant it is the evolution of these hierarchies and the results of the competition between them that will determine the fate of humanity over the next years decades and centuries just as they have over the past millennia"

		content: " Is It Really So Yes We have this truth from no less an authority than Sir Raymond Douglas Davies testifying back in 1971 kinks > Gotta stand and face it > Life is so complicated Even earlier back in 1920 H L Mencken offered us this comforting assurance hlm > There is always an easy solution to every human problem neat plausible and wrong I was thinking about life s complications recently when I heard Barack Obama s insightful interview with Brené Brown bbdtl The whole podcast episode is well worth a listen but just to cherry pick a few relevant nuggets > When I actually took my theories and started testing them in neighborhoods on the South Side of Chicago suddenly I started realizing Oh people are complicated and situations are complicated > If there s one thing I wanted to communicate in this book it s that the higher up you go in politics but I think this is true of any organization the more you will be confronted with challenges problems issues that do not yield a perfect answer > But just because something doesn t have a perfect answer doesn t mean it doesn t have a better answer So my interest in rigorous debate good analysis good facts is so at the end of the day you can make better decisions even though you know they re not going to be perfect > I do think that the benefit I got from my academic training was still having respect for the fact that as complicated as the world is there are still tools we have and the capacity to reason things out that we ignore at our peril So there you have a definitive consensus from cultural icons of three generations Yes Life is indeed complicated Does It Have to Be This Way At some point you might suspect that these people are making things sound more complicated than they really are I mean you know how these elites are if they didn t make everything so darned complicated then all these high priced experts would be out of a job wouldn t they But there s a very good reason why life is so complicated and has to be this way and it s called evolution evo To start with science tells us that life here on earth is not being guided by any divine intelligence and so we are not on our way to fulfilling some grand design No all forms of life here on earth ourselves included were produced by a blind watchmaker blwm as the saying goes and so there is no ultimate truth no great plan we re all just muddling through one day at a time one generation at a time trying to adapt as best we can to whatever reality is throwing at us this week In other words there is no perfect state to which we can aspire And so as Obama tells us there are no perfect answers and it often takes a lot of hard work just to figure out which answer might be a bit less bad than the others But the complications brought about by evolution don t stop there they run even deeper Because the innate mechanisms of evolution present us with a series of delicate balancing acts for which there are no definitive solutions Competition vs Cooperation Most of us understand very well that evolution involves competition One species competes against another individuals within a species compete against others and there are winners and losers And we see the same sort of competition playing out in our cultural evolution cult as well with competition between nations and between corporations and between individuals But of course evolution also exhibits many signs of cooperation Groups of chickens practicing peaceful coexistence lay more eggs than super chickens striving to dominate other chickens chk The cells within our bodies cooperate with each other in order to form the more perfect union represented by each human being And individuals and departments within corporations cooperate with each other in order to deliver products and services that are superior to those produced by other companies But who decides when we should cooperate and with whom vs when we should compete and against whom And on what basis are the decisions made When should states operate independently essentially in competition with one another and when should they cooperate as part of a united federation fed As noted above it s complicated Retention vs Innovation Two other required elements for evolution are retention of what works along with trials of new things Without change nothing would ever evolve But if you change everything all the time then odds are that nothing will work right ever again Again this balancing act is required for genetic evolution but equally important for cultural evolution And so we have the constant question of when should we innovate and when should we stick with the tried and true And when we try something new which new thing should we attempt Again there are no silver bullets no magic answers If in doubt about this just ask BlackBerry bbry and Kodak Simplicity vs Complexity Is it better to use simple designs or complex ones Better to be a large complex life form with a sophisticated culture or a simple coronavirus Better to be a large integrated organization or a small nimble startup Better to compete with a few complex expensive fighter jets or a large fleet of small simple drones drones Better to fix a flight control problem with a simple software fix or to design a whole new airframe 737 Well once again it s complicated And So Alright so life is complicated and it s going to stay that way At this point you might be wondering Other than ruining my day what exactly was your point with all this Just this when we try to over simplify issues and people and positions we almost always cause ourselves problems To put it another way extremist positions at either end of a spectrum almost always yield worse outcomes than more nuanced positions somewhere in the middle Is it better for each individual to have absolute liberty to do whatever they want or better for us all to be assimilated into a mindless conforming society Well probably better to have something in between those two extremes even if that does tend to make things more complicated Is it better to follow a religion whose leaders tell us exactly what to think or do in any situation or better to believe in an unfeeling mechanical cosmos devoid of all meaning Well perhaps it might be better to believe something in between those two extremes art Is it better to have a society run by capitalists in charge of big business or socialists in charge of big government Well once again I know by now you see this coming the answers are complicated bigb Now of course this sort of message doesn t sell well in today s media landscape We all would like a quick fix of simple certainty and no matter where we turn today we can find an army of pushers pusher waiting to feed our habit even giving the stuff away for free just to keep us hooked And so we ve grown used to consuming short spurts of alleged facts mixed in with provocatively worded eyeball grabbing opinions And just about all of these proclamations no matter the source no matter their political slant try to boil down complex people and situations and issues into simple conclusions And so it s good to be reminded from time to time that people and situations are rarely as simple as we would like them to be and not usually as straightforward as we are often told they are Of course big meaty books are one way to avoid short simple misleading answers And novels in particular allow us to explore in depth all the intricate twists and turns of complex characters and situations Here s a final quotation taken from such a work the novel Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng > In Pauline and Mal s house nothing was simple In her parents house things had been good or bad right or wrong useful or wasteful There had been nothing in between Here she found everything had nuance everything had an unrevealed side or unexplored depths Everything was worth looking at more closely And so I will end with my wish for all of us may you see the people and situations around you with new eyes and with greater nuance and find unexplored depths in everyday places and familiar faces And may you fully appreciate your complicated lives 737 https www latimes com local california la fi boeing max design 20190315 story html art blog hbowie religion storytelling and art html bbdtl https brenebrown com

		title: "More Love",

		content: "Any attempt to expound on the subject of love must first come to terms with the problem that we use the word in many different ways and situations There is romantic love There is sexual attraction There is the love of a parent for his or her child There is the feeling we have for a great work of art There is an appreciation we have for the natural world around us Which of these sorts of love are we talking about Musicians have expressed feelings of love in a host of different ways There is John Coltrane with his piercing reverential A Love Supreme Steve Miller sang of the pompitous of love having to create a new word to describe the full scope of it There are The Beatles singing She Loves You and then a few years later All You Need is Love in between singing of the word love > Everywhere I go I hear it said > In the good and the bad books that I have read There are Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys meditating on the topic > Late at night > I think about > The love of This Whole World We have Delbert McClinton singing about Plain Old Making Love Then we have the Gershwins claiming > In time the Rockies may crumble > Gibraltar may tumble > They re only made of clay > But our love is here to stay Robert Hunter and the Grateful Dead affirm that > A box of rain will ease the pain > And love will see you through Grace Slick and the Jefferson Airplane warned us with some urgency that we d better find somebody to love John Hiatt reminded us that we can choose you know we ain t no amoebas Then there s Laura Nyro swearing that We could build a dream with love We have Chrissie Hynde and The Pretenders instructing us > Now the reason we re here > Every man every woman > Is to help each other > Stand by each other > When love walks in the room > Everybody stand up Are all these sorts of love different things Or is it one thing felt and expressed in different ways at different times I tend to go with the latter interpretation For me love is an elemental human feeling that helps to bind us to one another and to the world around us It is a feeling of care and appreciation for and attachment to people and things of value that have an independent existence outside of ourselves And while love may not be all we need it does seem to be an essential starting point for everything else German basketball player Mo Wagner delivered a lecture on the subject at the end of a Sweet Sixteen game in 2018 Mo s team Michigan had just won the game at the buzzer with a fantastic shot by a freshman The Michigan players were all ecstatically chasing the guy who had made the final basket while the losing team Houston was trying to adjust to the sudden reality that their season had just ended One Houston player in particular Devin Davis was visibly sobbing on the court despondent over having missed two critical free throws Mo Wagner was crossing the court to celebrate with his teammates but upon seeing Devin stopped to throw an arm around him and console him Davis later said of the gesture davis It was a respect move for sure I appreciate him for doing that especially in that time He came and talked to me and consoled me and I appreciate that When Wagner was asked about the meeting he had a few simple words to say to explain his actions mo > At the end of the day it s sports and it s all love I feel for both sides British author E M Forster had a handle on the comprehensive nature of love when he wrote in Howard s End em > Only connect That was the whole of her sermon Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted and human love will be seen at its height Live in fragments no longer And another British author G K Chesterton had an important insight into the primacy of love gk > The cause which is blocking all progress today is the subtle skepticism which whispers in a million ears that things are not good enough to be worth improving If the world is good we are revolutionaries if the world is evil we must be conservatives These essays futile as they are considered as serious literature are yet ethically sincere since they seek to remind men that things must be loved first and improved afterwards Chesterton was right If we do not start with love in our hearts for people and things around us then it will be hard to convince ourselves or others that they are worth improving So while all of the other Practical Utopian big ideas are important they are nothing without love So let us love the seemingly broken and irredeemable parts of ourselves let us love our spouses and family

    url: "blog/hbowie/my-advice-to-young-people-of-all-ages.html",
		content: "We live in times of often bewildering choices and rampant temptation Over 30 of adults in the US are obese and drug addiction is running wild through our society especially in rural areas Average growth in real income has stagnated for American workers and economic inequality is reaching levels not seen since the Gilded Age Many pundits are predicting a future marked by both ecological collapse and economic marginalization for an increasingly large segment of our populace We can spend many hours debating what we can do to alter the course of society and to improve our common future And I m all for fostering and participating in these sorts of discussions Today though I d like to change my focus and offer some advice for what people can and should do to improve their own personal lots in modern life I have only a few recommendations and they re rather brief and straightforward although I won t claim they re easy 1 Figure Out Who You Are This is not a one time study but an ongoing process We ve all had stuff happen to us good bad indifferent And we all carry memories of these things with us whether we want to or not But at some point you have to decide what do you want to make of these experiences Which ones do you want to place in the foreground of your life and which ones do you want to move to the background What lessons do you move forward with And what do you want to pursue Friends teachers therapists mentors and wisdom teachings can all help with this > I always thought our house was haunted > But nobody said boo to me > I never did get what I wanted > Now I get what I need > > It s been a slow turning > From the inside out > A slow turning > But you come about > > Slow learning > But you learn to sway > A slow turning baby > Not fade away > > John Hiatt from his song Slow Turning https geo itunes apple com us album slow turning 6265873 i=6265648 mt=1 app=music 2 Educate Yourself We live in an amazing time There is more stuff to learn and easier access to knowledge than at any previous period in human history Whether it s National Public Radio or our Public Broadcasting System or your local library or Wikipedia there are any number of amazing free resources out there to help make you smarter and better informed At the same time though there are many ways to waste your time without learning a darned thing And there is never any shortage of people all too willing to help you do just that especially if it s to their financial advantage to keep you distracted and stupid Why learn The first reason is that it s fun Not just fun in the sense that learning offers a pleasant diversion but fun in the sense that it can give you a fuller richer appreciation of the world around you And it can help you do exciting things that you couldn t do without the appropriate knowledge The second reason to learn is that it will help you navigate through time and space You are on a journey no matter where you are or how long you ve been here and the more you know the more profitably you will be able to chart your own future course The third reason to learn is to stay relevant People who know things and who are able to continually learn new things will always be of more interest to others than people who know nothing or who haven t learned anything new in the last 20 years And unless you ve just won the lottery and are interested only in becoming a hermit relevance is a very good thing > Perhaps in the twenty first century populist revolts will be staged not against an economic elite that exploits people but against an economic elite that does not need them anymore This may well be a losing battle It is much harder to struggle against irrelevance than against exploitation > > Yuval Noah Harari from his book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century https amzn to 2EP8LdX 3 Make Time for Art Whether it s music or theatre or visual arts or fiction or film take some regular time to appreciate some of the best artistic works from our past as well as contemporary works And find some people you can discuss them with And spend some time researching what other people have said about these works and how they ve been influenced by them At the end of the day we are all human beings and many of our greatest rewards in this life will come from interacting with other humans Our appreciation of our own humanity as well as that of others can be incredibly shallow or mesmerizingly deep And there are no greater teachers of what it means to be human than the towering artists of the past and present and the timeless works they have fashioned for us So whether you study the works of John Coltrane or Emily Dickinson Leonard Cohen or Pablo Picasso Frank Capra or Guillermo del Toro Raymond Chandler or Ursula K Le Guin The Beatles or Laura Nyro make time in your life to allow art to enrich you > When I started learning about jazz I wasn t into any kind of art I had no idea it could have a practical purpose Now more than thirty years later I testify to the power of art and more specifically jazz to improve your life and keep on improving it > > Wynton Marsalis from his book Moving to Higher Ground How Jazz Can Change Your Life https amzn to 2EN8Cb0 4 Commit to Self Determination You have no doubt noticed by now that there are many people and institutions in this world who would like to help you decide what to do with your time and your money and your attention You may even have come to realize that not all of these people and institutions actually have your best interests at heart There are all sorts of addictions and diversions available out there and it s all too easy to succumb to them to be swept along with the tide of activities created by other people usually in order to somehow extract money from you without you noticing that they re now a little richer and you re now a little poorer The solution Learn to be mindful rather than mindless Think about what people are asking you to do and what their motivations are And then choose what you think will be best for you And learn to say no and walk away > I shall be telling this with a sigh > Somewhere ages and ages hence > Two roads diverged in a wood and I > I took the one less traveled by > And that has made all the difference > > Robert Frost from his poem The Road Not Taken https www poetryfoundation org poems 44272 the road not taken 5 Acquire and Conserve A Little Wealth No I m not talking about making your millions while you re still young and then retiring I m not recommending that you get rich or work your butt off for ten or fifteen or twenty years and then withdraw from the world once you ve made it And I m certainly not talking about falling for the latest get rich quick scheme to come down the pike What I am talking about is having some money in savings and perhaps even investing some of it and owning stuff that might reasonably be expected to appreciate in value over time Why Just because people with money have more options than people without Sometimes good education costs money Art sometimes costs money And if you re going to commit to self determination you re sometimes going to have to walk away from jobs and job offers that don t feel right and it s hard to do that if you don t have at least a little money saved up > Dave Ramsey laments about something more fundamental the loss of a certain kind

		content: "As our old year winds to a close and we pause briefly to compose ourselves before finding out what the next has in store I want to take a moment to offer up a prayer not to God but to all of us for a more integral sense of who we are in the new year Of all the great lies coursing through our culture these days the broadest the most mistaken and the most damaging has been the notion that some piece of our world should be elevated to higher prominence and viewed as move valuable even more essential than other pieces This is a lie borne out of isolation It starts with the feeling that we are cut off and separate from the world around us even that the world has no need of us And as this sense of isolation grows individuals come together and build a shared sense of estrangement And this simmering brooding resentment ultimately breeds rebellion an emergent sense that no it is not we who are of no value it is them the others those who seem so content to carry on without us oblivious to our very existence And so we enter into the world of Us vs Them a world in which each isolated individual and each splintered piece of our world is constantly scrabbling for advantage continually trying to assert our own importance and continually trying to diminish the significance of others Listen to me we scream We are the ones who are right we the chosen And down with everyone and everything else And of course our politics and our media continually reinforce this splintering because as isolated shards we continually crave this sort of reinforcement but also because it sells stuff and so it helps to continually transfer money from the many who consume to the few who own the means of production And the continual back and forth of who is right and who is wrong who is strong and who is weak who is important and who is to be dismissed convinces all of us that our greatest challenge is to pick the right side and then battle against the other with all our might But the great lie being told today is not that one or the other side is right or wrong No the great lie is that some of us are more important than others that the pieces are greater than the whole even that the whole does not exist that we are only fragmented pieces and that this is all we will ever be or were ever intended to be This is not the truth The truth is that no one individual no one group no one piece of our world is complete on its own or superior to the rest More than that no one individual no one piece is smart or enlightened or informed enough to fully see how all the pieces fit together to form something larger And so the truth is that our greatest wisdom lies in knowing that we each contribute to a greater whole even when no one of us can fully apprehend the full extent of that entire wholeness This is an integral wisdom a faith that all the pieces of our world integrate into something greater something worth being a part of Old and young Female and male Christian and Muslim Buddhist and atheist Doctor lawyer engineer builder artist teacher student and corporate chief Those from the East and the West the North and the South Those from the cities and those from the country The strong and the weak Those who work in the office those who work in the field and those who work in factories Those who remember the past and those who envision the future Human and non human Animal vegetable and mineral The air the land and the sea So many pieces forming one great whole And each piece important to the extent that it fits in with all the others allowing and contributing to an overall balance and a harmony So this is my prayer for the new year that we all appreciate our own importance but also the importance of other people other groups other species other pieces of our shared world not because we are all part of some great flattening in which everyone and everything is as important or as trivial as everything else but because we are all part of some great building each a piece of some great growing whole that we all can partially apprehend even if none of us might ever fully apprehend it If we can all begin to sense that each of us along with all the others integrates into some greater whole then perhaps the new year can be one in which we start to get our wobbly world back onto some kind of track towards a greater future I pray that together we make this so"

of God s existence directly it seems wiser to ask ourselves how we can best explain the facts above the combination of a nearly universal human belief in God combined with so far irreconcilable differences in what sort of God we believe in There seem to be most fundamentally only two possibilities 1 Human Belief in God as a Reflection of External Reality By this I mean that God exists in some observable way and that we can postulate some sort of entity whose attributes could account for the bulk of these observations Here we immediately run into multiple problems The first problem is that human beliefs about the nature of God do not seem to be converging in the way that other beliefs about external reality do If something really exists in an observable way then over time human beliefs eventually yield to a conception of the source of these observations that is consistent and stable However in consideration of human beliefs about God we simply see no such consistency convergence or stability Christians Buddhists and Muslims are not flocking in droves to some universal set of stories and beliefs that represents the true God instead all of these different versions of external reality remain separate based on beliefs that are all equally unsupported by consistent observations of the material world The second problem we encounter with this conception of God is that the steady progress of science as a means of understanding the world around us has in no way confirmed any of the various human beliefs about God The most startling of these scientific discoveries is the slow evolution of increasingly complex forms of life through the workings of natural selection natural selection If a belief in God were based on external reality then we would expect scientific discoveries such as these to advance some beliefs while disproving others however the principles of evolution seem to discredit all forms of religious belief When we consider the varieties of human religious belief we simply find no existing religious belief systems that included anything like evolution 2 Human Belief in God as a Reflection of Internal Reality This is the second possibility that human beliefs in God reflect some internal reality about human nature human nature If this were true then we might expect that religious beliefs are a form of story telling in which the figure of God is a powerful recurring symbol of some sort We might also fairly expect that the details of these various stories might differ significantly since they are only stories and since the details of such stories are offered as symbols themselves and to make the stories more powerful and effective Yet we would not expect the exact details to be the same if the stories were created independently since many different details might be used to symbolize a common internal reality Of course the varieties of human religious belief exactly fit these sorts of expectations All religious texts are based on an interrelated web of stories and while many elements of these stories are consistent in a general fashion they differ greatly in the details Also some of the general outlines of such stories seem to evolve over time and in fact seem to evolve in a way consistent with the development of human culture levels And so if we accept that human beliefs in god mirror some internal element of our human nature that an innate and powerful element of our nature is our culture and that our cultures evolve over time then we seem to have a set of beliefs that are remarkably stable and consistent that seem to hang together and reinforce each other that make sense In other words God is best understood to be a symbol that humans have created To see God in such a way is not the same as saying that God doesn t exist As Ken Wilber wilber puts it when describing the four quadrants of reality > But the main point is that this Left Hand dimension refers to the inside to the interior depth that is consciousness itself > > Q You said earlier that depth is consciousness or what depth looked like from within > > KW Yes exactly The Left Hand is what the holon looks like from within the Right Hand is what the same holon looks like from without Interior and exterior Consciousness and form Subjective and objective And this left hand dimension this interior perspective this view from the depths of consciousness is no less valid no less real than the exterior material view As G K Chesterton chesterton so elegantly stated it > The center of every man s existence is a dream Death disease insanity are merely material accidents like a toothache or a twisted ankle That these brutal forces always besiege and often capture the citadel does not prove that they are the citadel

folks in theory However it is hard to find many examples of this sort of autocracy working well in practice As if he knew we were feeling a need for more real world tests of these ideas Russian President Vladimir Putin has mounted an attack on Ukraine in recent days er weeks er months to give us all an example of how effectively a powerful autocrat can realize a decisive victory for the

seem to get their ideas about the effectiveness of autocracy after becoming convinced that most big business successes are the works of masterful all powerful CEOs And the ever popular business books ghost written for these high profile leaders no doubt help to perpetuate this fantasy Steve Jobs was one such business leader who was often viewed as an autocrat who ruled with a decisive take no prisoners approach to management Here s one story https 9to5mac com 2011 10 11 steve jobs book excerpt why he wore the black mock turtleneck uniform relaying how Jobs ruthlessly imposed his brilliant strategic will on the employees at Apple > Sony with its appreciation for style had gotten the famous designer Issey Miyake to create its uniform It was a jacket made of rip stop nylon with sleeves that could unzip to make it a vest So Jobs called Issey Miyake and asked him to design a vest for Apple Jobs recalled I came back with some samples and told everyone it would be great if we would all wear these vests Oh man did I get booed off the stage Everybody hated the idea In truth Jobs was a great believer in collaboration https www fastcompany com 1829788 exclusive new wisdom steve jobs technology hollywood and how good management beatles > My model of management is the Beatles The reason I say that is because each of the key people in the Beatles kept the others from going off in

chemistry was greater than the sum of the parts And this excerpt from a conversation with Walt Mossberg https www youtube com watch v= F7o5ipBbvQ at a D8 conference punctures more holes in the popular image of the successful business leader ruling with a singular vision and an iron hand > Jobs What I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and solve problems to make new products to make new marketing programs whatever it is > > Mossberg And are people willing to tell you you re wrong > > Jobs laughs Yeah > > Mossberg I mean other than snarky journalists I mean people that work for > > Jobs Oh yeah no we have wonderful arguments > > Mossberg And do you win them all > > Jobs Oh no I wish I did No you see you can t If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to you have to be run by ideas not hierarchy The best ideas have to win otherwise good people don t stay > > Mossberg But you must be more than a facilitator who runs meetings You obviously contribute your own ideas > > Jobs I contribute ideas sure Why would I be there if I didn t And so here Jobs touches on several principles that seem to make for successful leaders in actual practice + They should be qualified to contribute their own ideas + They have to appreciate the value of having wonderful arguments + They can t use their position or authority to win those arguments + People around them have to be able to tell them when they think they re wrong without fear of retribution + Their organizations have to be run by ideas not hierarchy + The best ideas have to win in order to motivate good people to stay and contribute + Leaders have to recognize that they have blind spots bad tendencies and so they need a team of respected peers who will sometimes keep them in check Do any of these sound like the practices or principles of an autocrat Want to wager that Vladimir Putin has any of these hanging on a wall at the Kremlin Or Donald Trump on the walls of Mar A Lago No the truth is that in practice autocracy tends not to be very effective because it runs counter to the principles that are needed to run almost any sort of modern organization Of course this does not mean that democracy is a perfect form of government As Winston Churchill observed > Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried And there are many forms of organizational structures and principles that embody what we might call egalitarian ideals to varying degrees with details that vary considerably But then that is one of the advantages of a democracy it is a flexible ideal that can be adapted to different circumstances with diverse approaches Whereas autocracy is defined by its very insistence on having one person who is always right and one set of approved ideas All facets of our modern lives once we look beneath the often shiny surfaces are complex complicated affairs It may be tempting to believe that one confident charismatic leader can solve all of our problems But such trust is generally misplaced often with horrific catastrophic consequences So let s keep working to improve our democracies and our approaches to organizational decision making But let s not be duped into believing that the simple answer of autocracy will improve our lots As H L Mencken said > There is always an easy solution to every human problem neat plausible and wrong Autocracy may sometimes sound like an easy neat plausible solution to all of our current problems Unfortunately in actual practice it almost always turns out to be wrong"

essentially the same things as the poorest You can be watching TV and see Coca Cola and you know that the President drinks Coke Liz Taylor drinks Coke and just think you can drink Coke too A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good Liz Taylor knows it the President knows it the bum knows it and you know it The sixties and the seventies were also the period during which our US President John F Kennedy confessed that one of his favorite books jfk was a James Bond spy novel From Russia With Love Later in the sixties I remember acquiring and reading all of the Ian Fleming paperbacks then loaning them to my uncle the chief engineer on a cargo ship never to see them again This was also the era that included the career of The Beatles Early on in 1963 John Lennon wryly remarked at a Royal Variety Performance in London royal > For our last number I d like to ask your help Would the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands And the rest of you if you ll just rattle your jewelry Lennon of course was using the stage to make essentially the same point that Warhol was The Queen listened to The Beatles famous and wealthy personages listened to these four working class lads from Liverpool and no amount of money could get you a better Beatles performance than the latest one that everyone was listening to on the radio This was also a period during which despite all the setbacks racial integration seemed to be making real headway Here s how one of the football players ahs at my newly integrated high school described his experience in the late sixties > I had a great coach a great football coach He was totally color blind The team was color blind and our relationships actually strengthened the school because there was no barrier in sports and that transferred over to other students In short this was a period of our history during which class distinctions seemed to be fading Sure some people had more money than others My mother drove a Ford Falcon my father drove a Mustang and my Uncle drove a Thunderbird But they all drove Fords everyone drove cars built in Detroit and the similarities between the cars they were driving were more significant than the differences And historical data shows inequality that this indeed was the period of the lowest levels of American income inequality in the last hundred years If anyone doubted that this period is now over then the recent meal served to the Clemson Tigers clemson football team at the White House along with the subsequent media coverage could easily have served to drive the final nails into the coffin No matter where you looked there was our President proudly spreading his arms wide welcoming the champions to tables coved with white linen and fast food the very best that McDonald s Wendy s Burger King and Domino s had to offer Stuff that Trump described as Great American food Because of course this was not a Coke is a Coke sort of unifying event for our society Instead it was a perfectly engineered media event designed specifically to highlight the vast divide between our societal elites and everyone else while media pundits were enjoying a predictable field day over the spectacle Trump supporters were once again identifying with their champion someone who had risen to the highest office in the land and yet still proudly enjoyed and served the same food that they ate on a regular basis This is the class division that propelled Donald Trump into the White House And while I generally consider his Make America Great Again rhetoric to be ill informed and misguided he has stumbled onto something here that none of us can afford to ignore Because this divide is real and is becoming more apparent everyday Whether it s Neal Gabler s piece in The Atlantic gabler on The Secret Shame of Middle Class Americans or Matthew Stewart s stewart telling us that The 9 9 Percent is the New American Aristocracy or Anand Giridharadas informing us anand that elite philanthro capitalists do more harm than good the truth is now out and available for everyone to see we are a society divided between the haves and the have nots the elites and the rest of us and the deck is increasingly stacked against the rest of us What s not so clear at this point is how to unstack the deck and start giving everyone a fair hand Because the chips have all piled up in certain corners and so simply dealing the cards fairly from this point on won t suddenly get our society back to where it was fifty years ago It took the New Deal new deal World War II wwii the Great Migration migr the G I Bill gi and the Space Race space to put a thorough end to our last Gilded Age gilded and there s no way now to just flip a reset switch that will erase all of the class and racial division that has built up in our society over a period of several decades While our path to future greatness may not yet be clear I think that we can draw some conclusions about the imaging that will be needed in our next US election cycle The up from humble origins story told by an old white person will not be sufficient the origins are too far in the past and the protestations of class equality are too transparently disingenuous for anyone to buy them The Alexandria Ocasio Cortez dance like nobody is

		content: "I was thinking recently about my own upbringing in Annapolis Maryland back in the sixties and it occurred to me that there were several aspects of my experience there and then that I took for granted but that are no longer very common today My own parents had divorced when I was nine and my brother and I were living with our Mom She was working and we didn t lack for any of the necessities but we were definitely on the low side of the middle class And yet we lived within an easy bike ride from more affluent families in the community We all went to the same public schools We Methodists all went to the same church There were a variety of good employers in the area Westinghouse Nationwide Insurance the Naval Academy to name a few There was a local newspaper We had network TV and AM radio but we all watched and listened to the same content at the same time If we wanted something more exotic to give us a taste of what was going on in the wider world then there was always a large selection of books at the public library plus the Sunday edition of the Washington Post Now I m not trying to convince you that I grew up in some sort of paradise lost this was not a perfect community But it was a relatively complete coherent compact local community Fast forward to today I live in North Seattle near Green Lake Now don t get me wrong I love Seattle my neighborhood and my neighbors But a family like the one I grew up in would have to live at least 30 miles from where we are today Families schools and churches in Seattle are sorted by income level The costs of living and of housing in particular have been rising so rapidly that long time residents are being forced out of their neighborhoods replacing established communities with gentrified housing carousing areas And everyone is attached to their own personal media stream individually customized to match their interests and worldview News and entertainment have become largely indistinguishable The printed word has taken a back seat to flickering images displayed on our personal screens and audio piped straight into our omnipresent ear buds Jobs in the area have also been stratified split between good paying tech jobs and low paying most everything else with a distinct but small band somewhere in the middle Large employers offer many services that in the past might have come from neighborhood communities They often offer on site child care their own commuting services gyms Wi Fi subsidized and high end cafeterias serving three meals a day baristas game rooms napping nooks and their own corporate cultures And so for employees of companies like Boeing Microsoft Amazon or Google much of their societal allegiance has been transferred to their corporate communities So is there a problem here I believe there is To understand the difficulty I think we have to start with the difference between community and society A community is a social network connecting people with one or more shared interests and some set of shared resources Communities are easy Most of us belong to more than one Employers provide some but others can be easily formed especially today through social media Society is different though A society consists of all the resources and institutions needed to care for its members and to ensure its own survival And so once we understand this distinction we can begin to wrap our heads around the problem we are facing the characteristics of the communities in which we participate no longer provide any sort of accurate reflection of the health of the society on which we depend And to make matters worse the tailored media streams that we consume daily no longer reflect any sort of reliable shared understanding of the health of that same society No wonder then that we have such a hard time agreeing on the state of society or on what is needed to preserve and improve it Growing up in Annapolis it was easy to get a seat of the pants feel for the health not just of our community but of our society Today though I feel like I m flying blind separated from the action on the ground by thick layers of clouds It s like navigating by instruments but with multiple panels of dials each vying for my attention and each offering conflicting reports on my speed altitude direction and fuel consumption Back then in Annapolis of course we still had different viewpoints different opinions different interests different religions different political parties but these all seemed to be contained within an overarching sense of our mutual dependence on one another within a shared society We might disagree but at the end of the day we had to get along with one another Today that sense of us all having to get along within a shared society seems to be gone We have lots of communities but it s clear that these aren t the same thing in many cases these fragmented communities just allow us to burrow deeper into our separate societal corners from which we can comfortably pass judgment on those in different corners or perhaps worse just ignore them altogether as if they didn t exist What s the solution The rapid paces of population growth technological change and urbanization are certainly making it harder to grapple with this issue It helps to have a common inclusive worldview core that can accommodate all of this diversity and yet help unite people on fundamental principles and values We certainly need face to face and side by side contact between diverse members of our society Perhaps we need virtual neighborhoods intentionally composed of people from different segments of our society since we can no longer trust that these will occur naturally from geographic proximity We need more emphasis on affordable housing to allow different income levels to live closer to one another We certainly need even handed and generous funding for public schools We desperately need local communities that contain socio economic racial religious political and ethnic diversity Whatever means we use it seems critical that we find a way to reconnect the various shards of our broken society in such a way that most of us can experience a shared reliable direct perception of the health of that enterprise And we need to understand anew that we are part of a common society that this society needs to make some reasonable provisions for us all and that our fates within this endeavor are inextricably woven together core tags core html doi http www ushistory org declaration document pew http www pewforum org fact sheet changing attitudes on gay

		title: "Our Three Human Approaches to Dealing with Problems",
		date: "05 Mar 2019",
    url: "blog/hbowie/our-three-human-approaches-to-dealing-with-problems.html",
		content: "We all run into challenges from time to time whether at work at home or in our communities In general I would suggest we have three different approaches available to us when we try to respond to such situations 1 Soldier On The first approach is to just keep your head down continue doing what you ve been doing make small adjustments as needed and trust that everything will work itself out This is essentially the same approach that you see in a robotic vacuum cleaner go in a straight line until you run into something then back up turn a bit and try again You could also think of this approach as think locally act locally It s also characterized by the injunction to keep calm and carry on At its least elegant it might be referred to as muddling through You could also think of it as a don t rock the boat approach In this first approach we tend to rely on our own experience our own knowledge and memories and on sensory inputs from our immediate environment and we tend to favor actions that produce immediately discernible results Because we are humans the inputs we consider include words and images from those familiar to us And because we live in the 21st century those familiar to us include many we may never have met face to face but have experienced repeatedly through various media channels 2 Refer to an Ideal This approach relies on having an image of what perfection looks like a template or pattern and then consulting that reference when facing an emerging issue The practice of asset allocation aa is an example of this approach in the investing world You establish your desired amount of risk periodically review your portfolio and then sell enough stocks or bonds to get back to your desired percentages A mechanic repairing a car or a technician repairing any sort of engineered product typically uses this approach When confronted with a malfunctioning item you consult a product manual drawing and or specification to see the ideal state to which a product needs to return in order to regain its lost functionality 3 Observe Analyze and Predict This approach of course is at the heart of the scientific method sm It s generally used to confront new challenges that haven t been seen before It consists of making detailed observations analyzing the data and then making predictions about what might happen under certain conditions All human progress depends on use of this approach Pros and Cons of Each Although the first approach Soldier On may sound the least sophisticated it is in fact the preferred approach in most cases Humans along with all living organisms are here today because our predecessors discovered stuff that worked and passed it along to us either via our DNA or via learned behaviors And each of us who have somehow made it to adulthood have done so by learning and repeating behaviors that worked for us If something has been successful in the past then that is the best predictor of it proving successful again in the future As humans we are loath to give up on something that has worked for us before not only because we know it has worked in the past but because we would then have to come up with some new untried option And we know how that usually works out The second approach Refer to an Ideal is more sophisticated and is usually needed to deal with more complex situations But it also requires a higher level of trust in some expert authority A mechanic consulting an engineering drawing may not have any personal experience to draw upon that would tell them the right action to take and so they must place their faith in the drawing they ve been given and in turn the perhaps unknown people who prepared the drawings at some time in the past One of the final scenes in the movie Goldfinger gf offers a great example of this tension Our hero James Bond has somehow made it through all the dangers confronting him in the first ninety minutes of the film by relying on his native wits charm skills and finely honed instincts In other words he s been using approach 1 But then with only seconds left he has to disarm an atomic bomb that is about to explode without setting it off Which wire should he cut Or is there something else he should do He looks about in confusion Nothing he has done before has prepared him for this Instincts fail him He s running out of time And then an actual expert on the scene reaches into the frame and flips a simple switch immediately stopping the countdown timer An expert presumably who had at some point been able to consult some drawings showing how the thing works When we have an emergency with no other options available to us then we re all happy to consult an expert But it s not our first choice And we usually have about as much respect for experts as Bond displays in his earlier meeting with Q the head of the weapons research and development department We tend to regard experts as theoretical types who are ill equipped to deal with real life outside of the laboratory The third approach Observe Analyze and Predict is the most sophisticated but also involves the most risk This is why peer review is such an important part of the scientific method Until a new solution has proven itself multiple times then it is inherently risky Most of us are happy to board an airplane these days understanding that human flight is something that has now been happening routinely every day for decades But it was a different story for Orville and Wilbur Wright wb back at the dawn of the 20th century when they were first trying to build a craft they could successfully pilot through the air They were rightly skeptical of most of the unproven truths being circulated by self professed experts and reports of their success were rightfully greeted with much initial skepticism Societal Implications The issue of measles vaccinations measles that has recently been in the news is a good example of how these three approaches can play out in our society for better or for worse The whole idea of vaccination vacc to prevent diseases like measles is a great example of the use of approach 3 This was a practice based on observation analysis and prediction And it became a widespread practice over time because it was shown to work virtually wiping out the appearance of many diseases in modern societies On the other hand even today there is nothing instinctive about taking your child to a doctor to get his or her vaccinations Your child wasn t sick before the vaccination and they weren t visibly improved after the vaccination You don t see anyone around you getting sick from these alleged health threats And why should you trust these supposed experts whose recommendations seem to change every few years anyway And what about real childhood problems such as autism that these experts don t seem to know how to control Couldn t these vaccinations be causing that problem And in the face of this confusion isn t just muddling through the best approach After all if your child does get ill they can always be given antibiotics antibiotics can t they And so we see how these various factors can play out in society when applying each of these three problem solving approaches Application to Politics When it comes to choosing our political leaders I would submit that we are heavily influenced by the factors discussed above regarding our three possible approaches to problems Our first tendency is to Soldier On one reason why incumbents have historically had such a large political advantage But our two party system in the United States is also an example of use of this first approach If things are going well we vote for the party in office If things aren t going so well then we vote for someone from the other party And if they don t work out in the next few years why then we throw them out and vote for someone new And so this sort of democratic process fits neatly into the first approach keep going in a straight line until you hit a rough patch then make a small adjustment and proceed onwards In many ways this sort of democracy two major political parties frequent elections term limits is almost the definition of approach 1 But then there is also approach 2 Refer to an Ideal And most of us tend to have some sort of political ideal to fall back on Maybe it s free market capitalism Perhaps it s the Christian Bible Or it could be the Constitution How about democratic socialism Or American exceptionalism Or the Civil Rights movement of the sixties No matter which you choose you will find a reassuring template for success and will be relieved to hear that all of our current problems are being caused by deviation from that ideal And how comforting this belief can be In the US we ve traditionally relied on the states to serve as our laboratories for approach 3 Observe Analyze and Predict Let a state try it out If it works out well then other states will adopt it And if enough of our fifty states can replicate the initial success then perhaps we will adopt the solution nationally Marijuana legalization marij seems to be going through this process in 2019 as this piece is being written Implications for Sustainability and Global Warming And so finally let us consider the novel human challenges of sustainability in general and global warming warming in particular A hundred years ago few humans saw these as problems And even today many of us can go through most days without suffering any immediate negative consequences from these issues And so quite naturally our first instinct is to muddle through to leave well enough alone to make small adjustments and then go about our normal business Everything will be alright because well it always has in the past hasn t it And then of course there s our lack of trust in the experts I mean they can t even all agree with each other disagree can they So why should we listen to them And even if we believed them none of them has actually dealt with these problems before so there s no ready proven ideal to reference So approach 2 is not feasible And then there s the problem of how to effect positive change By their very nature sustainability and climate change are global problems which means that they will demand global solutions And so these will inevitably require political solutions But how can we prove the effectiveness of any particular solution Because there is no way to replicate our entire set of global systems climatic environmental political legal economic cultural in a laboratory And so we not only have to use approach 3 and place our trust in experts and reach agreement on this through our political systems but we have to allow these experts to use our entire world our entire planet as their lab Viewing the situation in this way I think gives us some idea of the sorts of resistance we will need to overcome to deal with these new global problems successfully 1 We first have to convince people that this is a novel problem and that simply continuing to do what we ve done in the past is not likely to work We have to help people understand that our current and projected future human population sizes in combination with the per capita rates of resource depletion and environmental degradation needed to care for so many of us are simply not sustainable We can t just keep keeping on We ve got to try something new even though there is accompanying risk because the risk of not doing anything is far greater 2 We need to reference as many compelling templates as we can American involvement in WW II The race to land a man on the moon The original New Deal If we are to successfully confront the sustainability challenges facing us then we will need to call upon the political will the technological focus the global connections and the sweeping scope of governmental action displayed in such prior situations 3 We need to structure our path forward around a series of experiments including policy experiments We have to quickly try a number of different things learn from our mistakes adjust our plans and then continue on We can t convince anyone today that we have all the

		content: "In a previous post human history I talked about human history being best understood as a progressive spiral made up of four intertwining strands with the third of those strands consisting of our increasing ability to cooperate with each other This post is the first of several in which I ll elaborate on my understanding of this element of our human history As humans it can be fairly said that our superpower is the ability to work cooperatively with others of our species As Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari says in his book <cite> Homo Deus A Brief History of Tomorrow hd < cite> > To the best of our knowledge only Sapiens can cooperate in very flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers This concrete capability rather than an eternal soul or some unique kind of consciousness explains our mastery of planet Earth And evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson points out something similar in his recent book <cite> This View of Life Completing the Darwinian Revolution tvol < cite> > Our ancestors found ways to suppress disruptive competition among individuals within groups so that between group selection became the primary evolutionary force This favored group level coordination in all its forms including the transmission of learned information across generations But these seemingly simple ideas of cooperation and coordination turn out to be devilishly complex in practice especially in large undertakings Functional Patterns of Cooperation In an organization society of any appreciable size all of the following patterns of cooperation can be found 1 Direct apprehension of the immediate environment combined with application of internalized knowledge motivated by personally felt goals While you may initially protest that this seems to involve no cooperation at all it must be mentioned for it is the fundamental building block on which all of the following depend 2 Direct communication with peers In other words exchange of information and ideas with people you work with on a daily basis 3 Group understanding and acceptance of Shared Goals constraints norms contributions and benefits in other words team formation 4 Intergenerational Learning the transfer of knowledge skills competencies norms and values from an older more experienced generation to a younger less experienced one More broadly we could simply think of this as learning and guidance from experienced colleagues 5 Division of Labor and Specialization an arrangement in which certain individuals organizations focus on specific pools of knowledge and expertise 6 Standardization as applied to units of measurement product service designs and work definitions 7 Experimentation competition between alternative approaches to solving a particular problem 8 Independent Verification an arrangement that permits the validity of the results obtained by one worker team to be confirmed by another operating independently 9 Management Hierarchies an arrangement in which small 3 15 members teams of peers are each represented at higher levels by individuals from those teams with those representative individuals then forming similarly small management teams and with this same representative structure continuing upwards until reaching the top of the organization Knowledge of current conditions should be accurately communicated with appropriate summarization as information flows upwards through the hierarchy goals and resources should be supplied with appropriate decomposition as these flow downward through the hierarchy 10 Multi team membership An arrangement in which an individual is part of two or more different teams each with complementary but different goals Within a single large organization multi team membership is often associated with matrix management mm A frequent example is that of an individual or other organizational component with dual responsibilities one as part of a multi function integrated product team ipt and another as part of a consolidated functional unit or unit of specialization As part of the first team the worker is responsible for delivering a successful product on schedule and on budget as part of the second team the same worker may be responsible for maintaining and enhancing organizational expertise in a particular area of specialization Within a broader context though all of us participate in multiple teams we are members of families of civic organizations of professional societies of cities states and nations as well as working at our jobs within organizations of one sort or another 11 Informal Trust Networks connections between individuals who have come to know and trust each other either through prior work experience or through special assignments taking individuals outside of their normal daily working teams Note that trust may be qualified an individual may be trusted to be able to perform certain tasks in certain situations but without similar levels of confidence in other areas Note that trust networks may also involve pockets of distrust as in agreement that a certain colleague should generally be avoided at least for certain responsibilities In a healthy organization these trust networks should be widely dispersed and only partially overlapping so that someone I trust may know someone else whom they trust but who is unknown to me 12 Identification and Exploration of and Adaptation to Novelty Things change New opportunities and threats emerge more or less continuously Relevant developments must be identified explored and understood and perhaps integrated into an organization s other patterns of cooperation as identified above 13 System tuning monitoring consultation and or intervention to preserve and enhance the patterns of cooperation throughout an organization So there you have it A list of thirteen patterns of human cooperation defined in fewer than six hundred words Sounds easy doesn t it Well the main problem of course is that all these things must somehow be kept in balance and maintained simultaneously not an easy undertaking Common Examples of Dysfunction Here are just a few examples of how things can go terribly wrong An organization may be too focused on specialization and intergenerational learning with too little attention to the identification and exploration of new opportunities and threats Organizational hierarchies may be too focused on pushing direction down from above while paying too little attention to direct apprehension of the immediate work environment coming up from below Organizations may place too much emphasis on standardization to the detriment of patterns 1 5 There I ve just given you a capsule summary of why in the field of software development the Agile Manifesto am eventually upended the rule of the various Capability Maturity Models cmm Formal units of specialization may not agree with informal trust networks that is those who are anointed by the organization to be the experts in their fields may not be the same people whom workers in the organization actually know and trust Due to Retirements Relocations Redundancies intergenerational learning may be irretrievably lost Understanding of goals constraints norms contributions and benefits may not be shared within a team or between a team and its management Specialists may be too narrowly focused on their areas of expertise and insufficiently focused on the creation of an actual product conversely team members may be too focused on deliverables due tomorrow with too little attention to broader trends in their professions Independent verification of results may fall by the wayside in order to help meet budget and schedule goals Notice that the word competition is used only once above in the sense of evaluating competing approaches to solving a problem Yet many organizations fall back on using competition between employees as some sort of silver bullet for performance management This sort of competition usually works against all the necessary forms of cooperation listed above The Bottom Line Of course getting all of this right is easier said than done and in practice it is easy to get too much of one thing and not enough of another and so organizational cooperation done right involves a constant recalibration of forces to try to optimize the levels of healthy participation in all of the patterns listed above But hopefully having a fairly complete list of patterns of cooperation to keep an eye on will prove helpful since by far the most common organizational societal failing is to narrowly focus on only one or two of these at a time while ignoring the others am https agilemanifesto org cmm https en wikipedia org wiki

		title: "Paul Thorn and his 800 Pound Jesus",
		date: "26 Mar 2019",
    url: "appreciation/paul-thorn-and-his-800-pound-jesus.html",
		content: "I d been aware of Paul Thorn thorn for some time but didn t really become a fan until I saw him live last summer at The Ark ark in Ann Arbor I convinced an old University of Michigan roommate to come with me while I was in town as an opportunity to catch up but we were both caught off guard by how much we loved Thorn s show I ve been listening to Thorn s recordings regularly since then and can now bear witness to a great catalog cd that stands up to deep and repeated listening Musically Thorn reminds me of Delbert McClinton dc and a few other artists who have somewhat belatedly been collected under the Americana banner He has a great group of regular bandmates playing drums bass guitars and keyboards and they are more than capable of drawing on most American music traditions blues folk rhythm n blues soul country rock n roll gospel and so on to conjure up a strong effective varied and emotive backing for whatever song Thorn has chosen to deliver Thorn s voice seems a force of particularly American nature It s not pretty or showy and wouldn t ever be caught dead on one of the insipid television talent shows that are endlessly advertised these days but it is wonderfully expressive and deeply layered like a powerful piece of wood that has been torn from the depths of some aged tree with complex and unique grains that bely its troubled but ultimately enduring heritage No matter what he s singing at the moment listen closely and you can hear ancient American voices echoing down over the generations distilled into something as complex and satisfying as a fine aged whiskey As a musical ensemble Thorn and company are as reminiscent of The Band band as anyone else making a similar musical stew out of their mongrel American musical heritage and mixing rhythm instruments keyboards guitars and rough vocals with little respect for established genres but with endless respect for their material Which brings us to the subject of Thorn s songs Almost all of his material is original and he seems to write about and for a mostly white older rural rust belt sort of audience And most of his songs are remarkably simple on the surface And yet listen closely to his best compositions and he always seems to be speaking to us on multiple levels In this he reminds me of no one less than Ray Davies and The Kinks kinks For just as Davies refused to pander to American audiences and remained steadfastly British and sang about forgotten or vanishing English characters and traditions Thorn seems on just as contrarian a mission to sing about American scenes and characters that many of us might just as soon fly over or forget And he does this with just as much self awareness as Davies had letting us know in subtle ways such as the name of his label Perpetual Obscurity Records that he s fully aware that there is a broader younger hipper more lucrative audience out there It s not that he doesn t know about it he s just not interested in it This song from his first album Hammer and Nail is as good an introduction as any to Thorn s world Unfortunately the great original recording worth seeking out seems not to be available on the usual streaming services The best way to correct this problem is to buy the CD cd But listen along using whatever device and sources you have available and let s pay attention to the words > I saw a garage sale > Pulled up in the yard > Found a statue of Jesus > That was eight feet tall > He held out his arms > And he seemed all alone > So I loaded him up > And I drove him home Simple right But look at what Thorn s done here He s placed us in a particular slice of our American landscape If you are only used to life in one of our big cities then you probably feel like you ve been dropped onto an alien planet one populated with pickup trucks garage sales full of castoff junk and outsized religious statuary There s also an element of comedy here right A giant statue of Jesus being bought and sold at a garage sale It s hard to conjure up the scene without evoking an amused smile But at the same time there s also a sense of pathos Our main character is without a companion stopping at garage sales projecting his own feelings of isolation onto an inanimate religious figure I mean it sounds kind of sad doesn t it At the same time though this reference to the statue of Jesus holding out his arms and seeming all alone begins to lend this figure its own independent identity as if it was not just an image of something else but was actually something or someone on its own There you go Four paragraphs of mine to unpack Thorn s first eight lines Let s see what happens next > Out by my driveway he > Looks down the street > With long hair and sandals made > Of rebar and concrete > I painted him white > With a long purple robe > He s a rock of ages > On our gravel road Again there s a comic element This is not a conventional pious stained glass image of Christ but a figure with long hair and sandals not to mention a purple robe And he s made of rebar and concrete not marble We re not on a Rick Steves steves tour of European art treasures here but a Paul Thorn tour of American life outside the city limits arguably just as illuminating especially if we re more interested in the 21st century than the 16th And then of course there s the priceless last line He s a rock of ages on our gravel road mixing the high and the low the metaphorical idea of a rock of ages and the literal hunk of concrete now resting next to this guy s driveway the timeless nature of an unbreakable rock alongside the scattered gravel making up the road on which our main character resides And now we come to the first delivery of the song s chorus > He s an eight hundred pound Jesus > Standing taller than a tree > He s an eight hundred pound Jesus > A bigger man than you or me Again we find the comic mixed with the epic and again we find more playful ambiguity a bigger man than you or me I mean of course this 800 pound eight foot figure is literally larger than either the singer or the listener but we re also referring to the stature of his character aren t we But then is it the character of the person god the statue is meant to represent or is it the character of the statue itself Let s see how the next chapter unfolds > I thought losin my job was > The end of the world > Til my best pal > Ran off with my best girl > I felt suicidal > With no real friends > So I walked outside > With a rope in my hand Wait a minute is this still a joke It s getting awfully real isn t it There are no comforting double messages now Carrying a rope outside while feeling suicidal That s pretty explicit and there s only one thing it might mean > Out by that statue > There s a big oak tree > So I stood on his shoulders > And I counted to three > I had every intention > Of buyin the farm > But when I jumped off > He caught me in his arms How are we to interpret this It s hard to believe a guy trying to hang himself could accidentally fall into the arms of a concrete statue Is this a modern miracle At this point we should note that for a song referencing the central figure of Christianity it is decidedly odd that our singer has not once referred to the religious historical figure of Christ himself but has instead focused only on a particular statue of this personage Unlike so many others he is not claiming to have been spiritually saved by Christ but physically saved by the 800 pound statue of Christ sitting in his yard And so at this point in the song it feels like we have entered the realm of magical realism magic akin to a Guillermo del Toro deltoro film such as Pan s Labyrinth and The Shape of Water We re now treated to another round of the chorus and then to the concluding verse > I wanted to return > The favor to him > Cause I never had > A more solid friend > So I planted some flowers > All around his feet > And I bought him a flock > Of ceramic sheep So now after this brush with death saved only by the magical actions of a chunk of rebar and concrete we are returned to the comforting familiar bucolic scene of random religious statuary scattered across our rural countryside observed once again through the singer s wry lens playing with the double meaning of a solid friend So what are we to make of this song as a whole What is it about Before attempting to answer this question it might help to know that this towering concrete Jesus really exists FB and is happily owned by Paul having been passed down to him from his father Thorn says about it Every time I look at it makes me smile And this is what makes Thorn s musical world so damned compelling Because he starts with real people and events and then makes up these little musical stories about them allowing us to look down on his characters from an ironic distance while at the same town identifying with them so strongly that we can t help leaving with an enhanced sense of our shared humanity So what is this song about Let me try to give you some approximation of the thoughts and feelings I come away with Being human is hard People do suffer reversals of fortune Humans do sometimes feel lonely and isolated They do sometimes feel tempted to take their own lives And a belief in something larger than themselves is often what makes the difference And such beliefs do often seem silly when looked at from an outsider s perspective But hey we re all on the inside as well as the outside all in need of a solid friend at times all in need of something to believe in all in need of stories to tell ourselves all leading lives not worth living if they re bereft of some form of enchantment That s an awful lot of meaning to pack into a track clocking in at just under three minutes If you re not yet familiar with Paul Thorn and his work then I urge you to see him in person tour and listen in depth to his catalog itunes Just don t make the mistake of taking him at face

		title: "The Personal vs The Institutional",
		date: "01 Nov 2019",
    url: "blog/hbowie/the-personal-vs-the-institutional.html",
		content: " Trump as Person Writ Large In some ways we can think of the Trump presidency as the ultimate triumph of the personal perspective over the institutional outlook For Donald Trump of course everything is personal and all institutions are disposable Personal loyalty to Trump is deemed to be more important than loyalty to the office or to the party or to institutions of our government or to the US Constitution or to any religious moral or ethical traditions And this devotion to the personal of course is a large reason why he was elected in the first place Before anyone knew him as a candidate or as an elected official he was known to people only as a media personality His businesses were built around his outsized personality And his entire campaign was built around this image including personal appearances before thousands of admiring supporters And his candidacy primarily appealed to those who had become divorced from large institutions including many who actively felt abandoned by all such institutions such as corporations and governmental agencies Here at last they felt was a candidate who asserted the ultimate right of each citizen to be their own person to be judged only as a person and who demonstrated a belief in the primacy of personhood with every media appearance every tweet from his own personal account every personal attack on other persons leading to chants of Lock her up Policy discussions were cast aside and largely ignored as Trump s cult of personality came to overshadow all other concerns And this cult has only grown and deepened as Trump s term has progressed culminating now in the attempts of Trump and his followers to explain and justify why it should be acceptable for a sitting president of our country to strong arm the leader of another sovereign nation simply in order to extract a bit of dirt to be used in his next run for office And of course there is only one conceivable justification personal loyalty to Trump comes first before all else The Teaming Nature of Humanity The problem here is that this conflict between the personal and the institutional is a false dichotomy Here s a quotation from evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson s excellent book This View of Life Completing the Darwinian Revolution to help me flesh out this assertion > Multilevel selection theory tells us that something similar to team level selection took place in our species for thousands of generations resulting in adaptations for teamwork that are baked into the genetic architecture of our minds Absorbing this fact leads to the conclusion that small groups are a fundamental unit of human social organization Individuals cannot be understood except in the context of small groups and large scale societies need to be seen as a kind of multicellular organism comprising small groups And so while we are right to believe that the ultimate goal of human society is the welfare of the individual persons within that society it is folly to believe that these ends can be met without participation in and reliance on human institutions For if the human individual has been designed by evolution to function within small groups and our society is best considered as a multicellular organism made up of these small groups then our durable human institutions must surely be thought of as the organs within the social animal Turns out that the nature of our reality is not turtles all the way down turtles it s teams all the way up turtles https en wikipedia org wiki Turtles all the way down The Necessary Balancing Act This tension between the personal and the institutional cannot be resolved by the triumph of one over the other rather this tension can only be managed as an ongoing balancing act There will be times when our institutions fail us leading someone like Grace Slick in 1967 when the US was still deeply embroiled in the Viet Nam War to declare paraphrasing Irish writer James Joyce that I d rather have my country die for me And Trump s ascendancy can be seen I believe as another indication of failing institutions as our US government along with other neoliberal institutions around the world allowed national boundaries and distinctions to become blurred while putting their blind faith in the global workings of free market capitalism to unite all of us in some sort of mythical world order Our human institutions are of course fallible Boeing celebrated its centennial in 2016 noting how rare an achievement it is for a corporation to succeed over the course of a full century and at the same time setting its sights on continued health over the next hundred And yet here we are only three years into that next century with Boeing s CEO called to testify before Congress and asked repeatedly to resign while trying to explain how the institution that he led could possibly have designed a commercial airliner that caused hundreds of individual persons to uncontrollably plunge out of the skies to their fiery deaths below To make matters worse human institutions are often opaque mysteriously complex and seemingly unaccountable for their actions And so individuals become suspicious of a deep state operating within the institutions of our government unresponsive to the will or needs of the persons the institution was designed to serve or to the direction of the persons ostensibly heading these institutions Given these sorts of issues it s no wonder that we humans have trouble placing our faith in large impersonal institutions Which is a problem For the very continued existence of our species The Institutional Imperative Yesterday I attended a screening of the film Chasing Coral cc It s not a great film as judged by the aesthetic rules of cinema Perhaps not even a very good one But it convincingly conveyed a critically important message All over the world coral is dying at an astonishing rate Vast beds of coral are completely dying out because our oceanic temperatures are inexorably continually rising far beyond historic norms due to human caused climate change To put it in terms of the personal it s as if a human had a raging fever but with no ability to return their internal temperature back to the normal range that would allow continued survival These vast living organisms comparable to forests on land provide homes to all sorts of sea creatures And they will soon be gone All dead Taking entire ecosystems with them Having what irreversible effects on living humans No one knows for sure We re conducting an experiment And you and I are inside the confines of this experiment If it s any consolation you and I will be among the first to know the results cc https www chasingcoral com No one can set an exact date to the start of the Anthropocene epoch anthro but almost all scientists are in agreement that we re now in the thick of it This means that our current geological age is defined not by some cosmic event that changed the course of life on earth but by the rise of our human influence over other life forms anthro https en wikipedia org wiki Anthropocene And here we run into the limits of the purely personal perspective It may well be that you and I feel happy with the way things are going From our personal perspectives even our collective personal experiences things perhaps seem to be pretty good Maybe they re even getting a bit better And yet from a global perspective scientists look around us and see not just a few isolated problems but wholesale environmental collapse And a complete and accurate perception of the scope and depth of this collapse can only be obtained through the careful and extensive collection of unbiased data Which can only be done by large groups of humans working together working within and through various human institutions Richard Powers quite accurately put his finger on the nub of this problem in his Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Overstory > To be human is to confuse a satisfying story with a meaningful one and to mistake life for something huge with two legs No life is mobilized on a vastly larger scale and the world is failing precisely because no novel can make the contest for the world seem as compelling as the struggles between a few lost people The problem you see is that we are dealing with the tragedy of the commons toc on a truly global scale And it is impossible for any one of us perceiving and acting personally to even apprehend anything like the full scope of the problems we are facing let alone do anything about them toc https en wikipedia org wiki Tragedy of the commons As much as we may distrust our large institutions we are at a point in history where we have no choice except to act through them And so like young Greta Thunberg gt we have no choice except to confront these institutions face to face and demand that they accept responsibility and take meaningful action like Thunberg we must resist the appeal from institutional leaders to share our merely personal perspectives gtus like Thunberg we must instead insist that they listen not to us but to the scientists gt https en wikipedia org wiki Greta Thunberg gtus https www nytimes com 2019 09 18 climate greta thunberg html And additionally for those of us beyond our school years we must call upon ourselves to contribute to these institutions to participate in them to build new ones when needed to fix them when they break to help them become more effective and more reliable to help them succeed in doing what none of us can do individually Rather than retreating to our own personal perspectives history calls upon us to instead make our best efforts to once again form a more perfect union this time to promote the global welfare And it is only through institutions attempting to make real this more perfect union as imperfect as they may be that we can hope to secure the continued blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity Our personal fates are not separable from the fates of our human institutions In order to save ourselves we must save them direct them and ensure they are working effectively to achieve the goals that we set for them There is no other choice open to us"

		date: "23 May 2022",
    url: "blog/hbowie/playing-with-language-and-settin-the-woods-on-fire.html",
		content: "A couple of things that happened recently got me cogitating on the idea of language as playground First I had a chance to hear Anne Curzan https acurzan english lsa umich edu speak Curzan is the talented and engaging dean of the College of Literature Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan my alma mater and is also a linguist who studies the history of the English language Her bio states that she aims to promote a culture based in purpose and contributing to the common good the power of learning the value of play emphasis mine and the importance of well being Well I m here to tell you any time you stir together the value of play and the study of the English language in the same pitcher you re mixing up a cocktail that I will happily imbibe Now I m disappointed to have to report that my usual reference source has a rather dry and unsatisfactory definition of the word play suggesting that the word means only to engage in activity for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose But it takes no more than a cursory review of a text such as Wonderland How Play Made the Modern World https www penguinrandomhouse com books 533949 wonderland by steven johnson to see the meaning of the word begin to unfold in a much more interesting way For me the term means something like to fashion something new or novel in an uninhibited manner initially motivated only by the pure joy of creative experimentation And as a lifelong reader and English major myself playing with language is something that has fascinated me for my entire life There are so many possibilities different words different combinations different structures different ways that the words interact with one another different images that those words conjure up And once you begin to speak as well as write and sing as well as speak the possibilities expand even further I was reminded of this field of play again this week while listening to Delbert McClinton s latest album Outdated Emotion https music apple com us album outdated emotion 1608261734 The work consists primarily of covers of material that Delbert learned to love while growing up and I was already familiar with many of them but one in particular caught my ear called Setting The Woods on Fire It turns out that the song was originally recorded in 1952 by Hank Williams and written by Fred Rose and Ed G Nelson It was a hit for Hank and has been recorded by others since then so you may already be familiar with it but it was new to me Here are the lyrics but I recommend you listen to the recording https music apple com us album settin the woods on fire 1608261734 i=1608261743 as well not only to enjoy the music but also to hear how Delbert delivers the words > Comb your hair and paint and powder > You sing loud and I ll sing louder > You be proud and I ll be prouder > Tonight we re settin the woods on fire > > You re my gal and I m your feller > Dress up in your frock of yeller > I ll look swell but you ll look sweller > Settin the woods on fire > > We ll take in all the honky tonks > Tonight we re having fun > We ll show the folks a brand new dance > That never has been done > > I don t care who thinks we re silly > You be daffy and I ll be dilly > We ll order up two bowls of chili > Settin the woods on fire > > I ll gas up my hot rod stoker > We ll get hotter than a poker > You ll be broke but I ll be broker > Tonight we re settin the woods on fire > > We ll sit close to one another > Up one street and down the other > We ll have us a time oh brother > Settin the woods on fire > > We ll put aside a little time > To fix a flat or two > My tires and tubes are doin fine > But the air is showin through > > You clap hands and I ll start bowin > We ll do all the law s allowin > Tomorrow I ll be right back plowin > Settin the woods on fire Boy so much play going on here where do I start First of course there s the title and refrain Settin the Woods on Fire an invented expression that brings up images of working and playing hard in a rural setting using an entertaining and imaginative turn of phrase Then there s the usage of the words daffy and dilly likely influenced by the Daffy Dilly https en wikipedia org wiki Daffy Dilly cartoon about Daffy Duck released in 1948 Then there are the explicit references to play that somehow manage to include all the elements of the definition I offered above + fashioning something new or novel > We ll show the folks a brand new dance that never has been done + in an uninhibited manner > I don t care who thinks we re silly + motivated by pure joy > Tonight we re having fun Then there s all the wordplay within the lyrics + Interesting rhymes such as silly dilly chili + Fun word variants such as sweller broker and stoker + Intriguing juxtaposition of imagery such as the ways that the notion of heat is invoked starting with the title but then carried through with the promise that We ll get hotter than a poker And then there are all the anachronisms within the song which I appreciate as ties to an earlier time which is just out of my reach of experience but brought within the reach of my understanding by the lyrics and style of the song and helps me to better understand my own parents now deceased but not forgotten But your reaction to all this may well be + So what + Who cares about such things + What is being accomplished here To which I would first respond by quoting one of my favorite although lamentably fictional English professors Gervase Fen https en wikipedia org wiki Gervase Fen as recounted in Edmund Crispin s novel The Case of the Gilded Fly > Fen sighed We are all becoming standardized and normal Nigel The divine gift of purely nonsensical speech and action is in atrophy Would you believe it A pupil of mine had the impertinence the other day to tick me off for reading him passages regarding the Fimble Fowl and the Quangle Wangle https www poetryfoundation org poems 44604 the quangle wangles hat as an illustration of pure poetic inventiveness I put him in his place all right In the semi darkness his eye became momentarily lambent with remembered satisfaction But there s no eccentricity nowadays none at all And then should Fen s answer not suffice I would again refer the reader to Steven Johnson s treatise https bookshop org books wonderland how play made the modern world 9780399184499 explaining how play is such a powerful force in our world for although the initial motivation for creative play may be pure joy such activity often generates useful inventions that can enrich the lives of all of us And then finally I would remind the reader that language is the best vessel we have for containing and conveying important ideas and that a useful diversity of thought as well as a rich understanding of the human experience cannot be achieved and sustained if we limit ourselves to an impoverished language made up only of common and obviously utilitarian elements We humans have been playing with language ever since we contrived ways of speaking to one another and the fruits of this play have arguably made possible our entire pageant of human history Why stop now The worst that can happen is that we ll have a little fun"

complex for any of us to tinker with And so it goes with software The trend in most modern app development is to discourage hood popping to make simple things simple and to make anything more complex impossible As a result each piece of software we use has this nice hard outer shell known as its user interface and it is designed to be absolutely impenetrable so that we humans employing the software interact only with this carefully designed UI and are thus trained to never even think about what might be going on beneath the surface And in many ways of course this sort of setup represents a nice division of labor all of us technocrats on one side building the guts of these apps seeing what s going on inside with all of us users on the other side looking at the nice shiny outer shell and never having to consider what makes it all tick So what s wrong with this picture Just this human development and human activities generally don t work all that well when everyone is forced to spend all of their time in one silo or another Human affairs generally progress more effectively when our areas of interest and areas of vision and areas of knowledge all overlap a bit when we can stretch our legs from time to time walk away from our usual vantage points and see what things look like from a different perspective That s when we can learn from each other and piece together our fragmented shards of perception into a more comprehensive more inclusive whole I suspect Steve Jobs knew this better than anyone else working in technology That s why he said https hbr org 2011 08 steve jobss ultimate lesson fo > Technology alone is not enough It s technology married with the liberal arts married with the humanities that yields the results that makes our hearts sing And so when I set out to build Notenik https notenik app I did so with the clear idea that the app should be capable of handling simple things directly through its traditional user interface but should also allow users to pop the hood to see what s going on underneath and to undertake more complex tasks Here are all the ways in which Notenik allows hood popping 1 Notenik is open source software and all of the software code as well as documentation is hosted on GitHub https github com hbowie notenik swift and is available for anyone to view and potentially change 2 Notenik stores all of its info in plain text files that can be opened and inspected and modified using any text editor 3 Text files are stored in folders and the user gets to choose where the folders will be stored 4 The format in which Notenik stores its data is meant to be highly user readable as well as machine readable so that pretty much anyone viewing the contents of a file in a text editor can immediately see what s going on 5 Notenik is highly user configurable so that each user can tailor each collection of notes to his or her own particular needs 6 Folders full of text files generated by other applications are generally fully interoperable with Notenik even if they are not formatted in exactly the same way that Notenik would prefer 7 While Notenik is designed to help users manage collections of text files in various productive ways and allows a user to edit all of a Note s fields within its own interface Notenik is not itself designed to be an advanced text editor This is why Notenik comes with two key menu actions both with handy keyboard shortcuts + `Text Edit Note` CMD T This will open the current Note in the user s preferred text editor + `Reload Note` CMD J This will reload the current Note from the latest version of the file that has been saved to disk 8 In order to fine tune settings for fields it is sometimes necessary to use a text editor to adjust a Collection s template file using OPT CMD T and OPT CMD J 9 Notenik is designed to convert a user s Notes into HTML the language of the Web and offers multiple opportunities for users to adjust the HTML layouts being used including adjustments to the CSS style sheets used to control the overall appearance of the generated HTML HTML and CSS are both written in plain text and can also be edited via any text editor 10 Advanced HTML generation also makes use of special text files used for scripting 11 Notenik can import and export user data in any of several common non proprietary plain text formats such as CSV JSON and OPML with no data loss 12 And now Notenik even has its own Discourse forum https discourse notenik app where users and developers can have open discussions about the workings of the application in the past present and future Now Notenik will not be everyone s cup of tea for a number of reasons And not every app can be expected to allow as much hood popping as is the case with Notenik On the other hand I do think it s vitally important to our society for developers to offer greater levels of transparency and tinkering to users and for users to begin to expect greater levels of transparency and tinkering from their software Wikipedia is a great example of the benefits of this sort of approach anyone can see and edit the source code for the pages that appear within this vast online encyclopedia On the other hand most of our social media platforms are great examples of what happens when users are denied access under the hood secret algorithms manipulate the feeds of information that we see twisting our minds and emotions and attitudes to benefit the financial objectives of the companies that own and operate the algorithms It s an issue that all of us should think about As developers are we holding our users back by keeping them confined to such small safe spaces that are completely under our control As users are we really being helped by software systems that force our attention and actions along such carefully manicured paths surrounded by such insurmountable guardrails Perhaps it s time to start thinking that maybe just maybe there might be a better way In the meantime if you d like to use Notenik without ever taking a peek under the hood that s perfectly fine On the other hand if you d like to see more of how it works and fine tune things a bit feel free to pop that hood"

		title: "A Practopian Approach to Gun Issues in the US",
		date: "27 Feb 2018",
    url: "blog/hbowie/a-practopian-approach-to-gun-issues-in-the-us.html",
		content: "The Florida school shooting stoneman once again propelled issues surrounding gun violence into the forefront of our national dialogue The big ideas at The Practical Utopian may seem very broad and general but I d like to illustrate how they can be usefully employed in a specific debate such as this one Mission The mission of The Practical Utopian is to identify and promote big ideas that will result in better outcomes for humanity Let s try to remember that when all is said and done if we haven t advanced our mission then we ve failed This is the ultimate acid test for the direction of our discussions we re trying to create a better tomorrow In this case we re trying to create a future in which fewer innocent people are killed by guns Balance The first Practopian value values is balance and we state it like this > We believe in striving for balance between competing concerns Although all of the values on this list are important to us we have no desire to establish any one of them as fundamentally absolute Valuing balance above all is important because it is all too easy to let our discussions get hijacked by one side or the other as each strives to uphold some fundamental right that supports their side and demonize their opponents as having a completely opposite view In this case we want to uphold the value of liberty and specifically the right to keep and bear arms On the other hand the value of balance reminds us that we cannot insist on a completely unfettered right for every citizen to bear every sort of weapon in every possible situation the value of balance requires us to recognize some reasonable constraints on this particular liberty in order to achieve a greater good for society as a whole An Integral View As Practopians We strive to integrate integral multiple diverse human perspectives in order to arrive at a more perfect understanding of the truth With that in mind let s look at some additional perspectives we might usefully consider Value Creation Another Practopian Core Belief is in the importance of creating value value for one another We state it like this > It is in the best interests of society to encourage its citizens to engage in activities that will create value for themselves and others and society at large and to allocate capital so that the greatest amount of it is available for use by those with the strongest likelihood of using it wisely So it may be useful to consider how guns create value for people Using guns for hunting is certainly a way to create value Use of guns by our military and our police forces is certainly important to maintain our security And it s clear that many people get something valuable if intangible from their experience of owning and discharging firearms We don t want to discount these valid uses for guns On the other hand we do need to be prepared to weigh the costs and benefits of various sorts of gun ownership in a reasonable fashion Diversity We Practopians also believe in diversity and state our belief as follows > We believe in the diverse expression of human potential And so while I m not someone who has ever felt the desire to own or shoot a gun I can confess to consuming a lot of fiction in which guns have played an important role I m not immune to the appeal of guns And I certainly recognize that there are other people who do want to handle guns in a responsible manner and I have no interest in marginalizing or criminalizing these sorts of people if we re serious about creating a more inclusive society then we need to include law abiding gun owners along with people of color gays and other minorities Critical Thinking At this point it may be time to introduce our Practopian principle that advocates for critical thinking > We believe that we can produce better outcomes for humanity through the application of critical thinking critical thinking and the use of the scientific method science One of the statements that surfaces frequently in our national debate on this topic is the assertion that Guns don t kill people People kill people Very well True enough Guns don t kill people Point accepted But then let s ask ourselves what do guns do And then I think the unavoidable answer is > Guns enable us to kill more quickly and efficiently So yes people do get angry they take drugs they grow despondent we humans are vulnerable to all sorts of feelings and situations in which it might feel like a good idea to take someone else s life or to take our own We humans aren t perfect imperfection And so yes people do sometimes wish to kill But does it add value to our society to have such ready access to machines whose only purpose is to allow us to kill more easily and more efficiently This seems to be an important question we need to collectively answer for ourselves Science We Practopians believe that science is one important way of understanding the universe in which we live We don t think we have all the answers and we think it s important to fund more research atlantic so that we can get more answers On the other hand we need to also pay attention to the data we already have available And while the data offered up in these debates frequently brings to mind Darrell Huff s classic remark If you torture the data long enough it will confess to anything most observers seeking any kind of objectivity in this context seem to conclude that the available data indicates that all other things being equal having more guns in a community results in suffering more lethal gun violence This piece from Vox vox is a good example Stories and Storytelling Practopians understand that we humans create meaning for ourselves through storytelling stories This trait is particularly relevant to the gun debate because our American cultural heritage probably contains more stories of Americans successfully defending themselves and others with guns than it does any other single narrative arc This American belief in the efficacy of guns is also reinforced by our special history We used guns to achieve our independence We used guns to expand our American boundaries We used guns to preserve our union during our Civil War We used guns during World Wars I and II to defend freedom not just for us but for others all around the world Our national experiences in the two World Wars I think further explain our love of guns Unlike many European countries we did not suffer either invasion or occupation during these 20th century conflicts In WW I we lost 0 13 of our population in deaths attributable to the war wwi In contrast the United Kingdom lost about 2 of their population and France lost over 4 So while Europe was sick of war and guns by the end of WW I the US was still able to see them primarily as heroic instruments Similarly the US lost only 0 32 of our population in WW II wwii This is roughly one tenth of the 3 0 average for all countries involved in the conflict The United Kingdom and its colonies lost almost 1 of their population Germany lost over 8 Russia lost over 13 and France lost almost 1 5 of their population Another factor affecting American attitudes towards guns can be seen in our relatively low population density Even though America has a large population it has an even larger expanse of geography When we consider average people per square mile the US comes in at position 185 when all countries are ranked by population density popdensity We have an average of 86 people per square mile compared to 319 for France 601 for Germany and 702 for the United Kingdom So when we Americans visualize how guns are used in our country it is still relatively easy for us to see them being used out on the range out West on farms and ranches and other rural areas Use of guns in these contexts still has considerable appeal for us even for those now living in more suburban environments Also because of the timing of our own American battle for independence images of ordinary citizens taking up guns to battle an oppressor seem to be forever fixed in our collective consciousness Whereas older cultures might maintain a reverence for swords or bows and arrows such weapons ultimately played no triumpant role in our own national heritage and so we Americans have seemingly transferred all such affections to firearms These unique American cultural elements matter and must be taken into account as part of any discussion of guns in our society Cultural Evolution Practopians recognize that no human culture is fixed or static or absolute and that our collective beliefs attitudes and institutions are in a continual state of evolution culture We can see this sort of cultural evolution in the gradual acceptance within our society of racial integration and then acceptance of equal rights for gays These sorts of attitudes don t change overnight and they don t change for everyone at once Sometimes it seems like they will never change But then some dramatic public event something like the Selma marches selma catches the public s attention and galvanizes us makes us feel like we can t allow similar tragedies to continue to play out in our society before our very eyes And it is often an event such as this that pushes our society as a whole past a tipping point pushes those seeking change past the halfway point giving them new power to make the rules and to influence further societal changes For the gun debate in the US of course the recent shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School may yet prove to be such an event and provide sufficient impetus to propel us past a tipping point For while we have sadly but inevitably grown accustomed to mass shootings in the US over the past several years there are elements of this particular event that seem to be capturing public attention and exercising lasting influence not just images of the students who were murdered but the images and voices of their classmates students still alive and close to voting age expressing frank disbelief that they live in a society that is willing to continue to tolerate such a profusion of weapons designed solely for killing with such terrible rapidity and finality When we open our eyes and ears and hearts and minds to these young people it is increasingly difficult for the rest of us to return to the status quo that we have grown so accustomed to Individual Action We Practopians believe that ordinary individuals individuals have the power to shape our cultural evolution individuals like the survivors of the recent shooting like you and like me and our goal is to help all of us make broader better informed more deeply felt more conscious decisions that will help us advance towards a more positive future Summary So where does all this leave us Here are some key points worth remembering as we all continue to participate in conversations on this important topic with politicians with fellow citizens and with our children Our collective culture often seems to change slowly but it does change over time America has a particularly strong attachment and reverence for guns and this certainly won t change significantly in any of our lifetimes We all have a responsibility to take action to help prevent such terrible massacres in the future It s important to respect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens who wish to own guns for lawful purposes Rational and productive discussions will be easier if we give up trying to defend extreme positions and stop demonizing those who have opinions and interests different from our own It is hard to visualize any sort of reasonable compromise that will continue to allow weapons designed for mass slaughter to be so widely distributed within our

		title: "The Progressive Path Forward A 12 State Strategy",
		date: "29 Jun 2020",
    url: "blog/hbowie/the-progressive-path-forward-a-12-state-strategy.html",
		content: "By now leading progressives are starting to realize that they face some severe structural impediments if they are serious about getting real progress in the United States What do I mean by real progress Let s just list a few common reasonable goals LGBTQ rights Immigration reform Protection for the environment Prison reform Policing and judicial equity for minorities Better gun legislation Abortion rights Increasing income and wealth equity For most people who call themselves progressives I think that the list above would be accepted without much fuss We all want these things But how do we get them Here we run into a population distribution problem Modern progressives are mostly found in our large urban centers while conservatives tend to be clustered in our more rural areas https www washingtonpost com politics 2019 03 05 why are urban rural areas so politically divided Unfortunately for progressives our urban population is increasingly becoming concentrated in only a few parts of the country Here s the way one article https www governing com now The Economic Reality Thats Splitting the Country Apart html puts it > The nation s economic activity is increasingly concentrated in a tiny fraction of major metropolitan areas By nearly every measure that matters job growth income growth share of business creation and investment there are about two dozen metros capturing the lion s share of the wealth Which is fine except that when progressives try to achieve their goals at the national level they run into three major structural barriers The electoral college As happened in 2016 a presidential candidate can lose the popular vote but still win the presidency The senate where every state no matter how small its human population gets the same two votes The process for amending our constitution which requires approval by all but twelve of our fifty states No wonder that Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin in their book We Are Indivisible gl summarize the situation by saying Our political system is not equipped to deliver solutions in fact it s equipped to block them So how do we progressives advance our agenda when so much of the country s geography is dominated by conservatives It s tricky But here are the components of a plan that will allow us to get there 1 Patience and Strategy This is not a plan that will achieve all of its results in a single election cycle or perhaps even a couple of them 2 A Sympathetic President My plan doesn t require our president to be an active supporter or leader but we need to elect a president who will not obstruct progress 3 A Focus on Demonstrable Results and Broad Positive Impacts While working on all of this progressives need to focus on demonstrable results that will produce felt benefits for a large majority of the population 4 Policy Formulation and Coordination at the National Level In We Are Indivisible Greenberg and Levin summarized the work of the Koch brothers by saying > they built an extraordinarily powerful network bringing together a coalition of conservative donors to fund think tanks advocacy groups messaging firms academic institutions and individual politicians Progressives need a network that is similarly well organized and funded But to start with we need a national progressive group let s just call it a think tank that can formulate sensible coherent policy along with model legislation at the national level 5 Coordinated Implementation at the State and Local Levels National leaders including but not necessarily limited to elected officials then need to plan and implement working with and through selected local elected officials a coordinated rollout of the target policies and legislation in left leaning states and cities This can include pilot efforts in regions that are early adopters possibly followed by suitable modifications and then by implementation in late adopters Note that this will require progressive majorities at the local level but not at the national level 6 Cooperation Not Competition Between Progressive Population Centers When Amazon conducted a nationwide search for new headquarters states and cities were falling all over themselves to see who could offer Amazon the sweetest deal and the largest tax incentives But why let big companies force us to compete with one another allowing them to walk away with sweetheart deals and leaving the winners with buyer s remorse Instead why not work together to come up with reasonable terms and then let companies pick cities based on the actual attributes of the cities and the companies own lists of priorities This way cities and citizens win and big companies can t bully us into accepting terms that leave local governments with all of the problems without the tax base needed to solve any of them 7 Intentional Distribution of Work And as long as progressives are cooperating why don t we work together to encourage large companies to move work to areas of the country that need it This would not only help the people in those communities it would help to expand our progressive base to new parts of the country Why do all of our large successful metropolitan areas feel like they need to endlessly continue their own growth Is this really what their citizens want Or is it just something that makes their political leaders wealthier and more powerful 8 Success Stories The advantage held by progressives is that unlike the conservatives we actually want to do things that will benefit most people So unlike the conservatives we don t need to keep any of this a secret No instead we need to shout it from the rooftops We can let everyone know what we re planning and what we re doing and how it s turned out In doing so though we need to present real progress as wins for the progressive movement not just as isolated victories for certain local politicians Let s talk openly about how well progressive policies and legislation are working and point to the areas where they ve been implemented 9 Real Competition between Progressives and Conservatives But of course if we re going to talk about how well the progressive agenda is faring we need to compare and contrast it with something else Here s where the 12 state part of the strategy comes from In order for progressives to pass even the smallest most popular constitutional amendment we need ratification by 38 states Which means that as many as 12 states can remain solidly conservative without blocking progress So why not pick twelve states and allow them to be suitable models for the conservative agenda I don t have an authoritative list but here s a beginning group to help start the discussion See below for the candidate states along with the numbers of electoral votes held by each 1 Alabama 9 electoral votes 2 Alaska 3 electoral votes 3 Arkansas 6 electoral votes 4 Idaho 4 electoral votes 5 Mississippi 6 electoral votes 6 Missouri 10 electoral votes 7 Nebraska 5 electoral votes 8 North Dakota 3 electoral votes 9 Oklahoma 7 electoral votes 10 South Dakota 3 electoral votes 11 Utah 6 electoral votes 12 Wyoming 3 electoral votes So let s encourage conservatives to put their best feet forward in these states Let them show us what they ve got And then let s point out the differences over time as progressive states show real progress and conservative states stay stuck in the mud The Bottom Line Progressives tend to be united in their resistance to Trump and the current GOP but tend to fragment themselves over everything else But our nation and our world cannot stand another round of seesawing back and forth between progressives and conservatives leaving us deadlocked more often than not unable to make any real progress What we need instead is a viable forward looking strategy that will work consistently over the long haul making real progress along the way And if progressives are serious about making progress for most of humanity then we need an approach like this one that includes competition between competing ideas and a disciplined approach to trying out those ideas and honestly assessing the results Simply doing what feels good won t keep us in the driver s seat for very long What I ve tried to present here is a workable way forward Here s hoping the progressive movement can organize itself well enough to make real progress over a period measured in decades and not just one or two election cycles gl https book indivisible org"

		title: "The Progressive Problem",
		date: "10 Jun 2019",
    url: "blog/hbowie/the-progressive-problem.html",
		content: "For progressives in the US and indeed in many parts of the world recent events have called into question our faith in the goodness of people and in our continued march forward towards a better tomorrow It s only been roughly a decade since those of us in the US were celebrating in amazement the election of Barack Obama obama as our president an event that seemed to usher in a new era of progressive values Since then however we ve seen the election of Donald Trump an event that daily seems to repudiate all the victories we thought we had won all the bridges we thought we had crossed And now in many states we are seeing new abortion laws abortion that represent a fresh resurgence of a repressive Christian right No wonder zombie movies have been popular of late so many of us feel like increasingly isolated survivors having to fight off forces that we thought were previously vanquished and long buried forces that seem to be arising all around us springing at us from all sides Many of us believed Martin Luther King Jr when he said that The arc of history is long but it bends towards justice Increasingly though that arc seems to be bending towards nationalism populism racism mass murder environmental collapse and a sort of modern corporate feudalism What went wrong I won t pretend that there is any single simple neat answer to this question For today though I d like to approach this question from a broad cultural perspective What do I mean by culture I ll offer you a four part definition 1 A set of shared beliefs practices institutions images and stories 2 that help to guide our personal growth as well as the smooth operation of our society 3 that are passed down from generation to generation 4 and that provide for their own continued evolution It s hard to overstate the importance of culture to us humans Without a viable culture we are no more than animals Culture is the source of all of our super powers Discard or degrade our culture and we all suffer Without culture we can no longer communicate effectively we can no longer trust each other we cannot learn from the past and we can no longer work together towards complex common goals Culture is not static It evolves But just as genetic evolution works by keeping most of what is passed down making only a few small changes at a time cultural evolution works in the same way keeping many elements that were passed down from prior generations then changing a few things to better adapt to our ever changing environment This is why George Santayana famously declared sant > Progress far from consisting in change depends on retentiveness When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement and when experience is not retained as among savages infancy is perpetual Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it And so with this understanding as background we are finally ready to consider the state of our culture under the care and custodianship of progressives Let s first consider same sex marriage This can fairly be considered a progressive success since public support for same sex marriage in the US ss has been rising strongly over the last decade or so with 67 of the US now supporting this institution according to a Gallup Poll done in 2018 But then this is a good example of starting with a cultural institution that s been passed down to us and then making what are after all relatively minor changes to it We re still supporting marriage and still supporting families as they ve existed for millennia but are just expanding these traditions to be a bit more inclusive including spouses and parents who are part of the LGBTQ community So this is a great example of progressive cultural evolution But what else do we find as we look around our modern progressive landscape One of the interesting things we see is a plethora of institutions all branding themselves as progressive activists Counting groups like Indivisible indiv I m sure I get at least 20 emails a day from different organizations all looking for my support to help advance a progressive agenda And we ve got over 20 candidates now running for the Democratic presidential nomination dems as well as Howard Schultz schultz a centrist independent who also says he supports many progressive values And what unites all of these leaders and organizations under a progressive banner What do we believe in Where can we look for a statement of our foundational principles What of value has been passed down to us and how do we hope to further improve upon it In other words what are the key elements of our progressive culture I mean other than opposition to Trump and the political party that he now leads And here s the problem It s hard to say As an example look at this paragraph from the Indivisible About page > Brought together by a practical guide to resist the Trump agenda Indivisible is a movement of thousands of group leaders and more than a million members taking regular iterative and increasingly complex actions to resist the GOPs agenda elect local champions and fight for progressive policies So that s it resistance to Trump and the GOP And what do they mean by progressive policies They don t say Not just here but anywhere Read the rest of the page about for yourself if you like but you will nowhere find any attempt at a definition of what they mean by progressive nor any reference to any other guiding document And so when we ask ourselves why in the world people would vote for Trump and the Republicans we must consider how things might look to a large portion of our population 1 Many elements of our modern life seem to be going from bad to worse Things like housing child care education and health care seem to continually get more expensive Decent jobs are disappearing or are out of reach Taxes are high especially for those with lower incomes Our society is continually being disrupted by new technology Terrorism is a constant threat Rural and semi rural lifestyles seem impossible to maintain as people businesses and jobs continue to migrate to densely populated urban centers cities in which homeless people traffic jams and trash seem to be everywhere 2 The news which used to be something we could easily catch up on in the morning or evening has now become an endless 24 hour barrage coming at us from all angles continually keeping us on high alert telling us of terrors that have just happened are unfolding as we speak or are likely about to befall us 3 All around us we see familiar traditional institutions being eroded People no longer speak English We see cars on the road with names we don t even know how to pronounce On the one hand we see human flesh everywhere covered by tattoos while on the other we see women from foreign lands covering as much of their flesh as possible with clothing from head to toe Brightly painted e bikes and scooters invade our neighborhoods like plagues of locusts All cultural norms seem to have been abandoned 4 And then we hear that the slogans for our country s largest companies are phrases such as Move fast and break things break and Every day is day one 5 If this is progress then you can keep it 6 And so with much of the culture we have inherited seemingly dissolving daily around us we look for familiar cultural artifacts that we can hang on to The Bible The Church The patriarchal family The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution The flag Statues of past leaders Things that have survived for hundreds or even thousands of years And we find ourselves drawn to spokesmen who are passionate about defending some of these same artifacts and institutions that have been passed down to us 7 And then when the progressives come to call they don t seem to be for anything other than the freedom of every individual to do whatever they choose and the supposed rights of every individual to have handed to them everything that we and our forebears have had to struggle for and earn through the sweat of our brows Open borders free college a guaranteed annual wage and who knows what else But those same freedoms and rights seem to be the very forces that are tearing at the fabric of our communities 8 And while none of us are experts on what it takes to maintain a functional society and most of us have probably never heard of George Santayana didn t he pitch for the Marlins deep down we know that something of inestimable value is slipping away from us and so we hang on tight to whatever we can whatever symbols and signifiers are still available Do you start to see the problem we progressives are facing We are peddling resistance to the Republicans and are offering as an alternative what exactly Freedom is a great thing and limitless rights are easy things to assert but these rights and freedoms are wholly insufficient when considering the essential elements of a viable culture utterly incomplete when thinking about the elements needed to keep our society intact functional and moving forward Here s one symptom of the problem I m pointing out when naming the documents we progressives most often refer to as our touchstones we tend to cite judicial interpretations with pedestrian names such as roe v wade and brown vs brown Really We progressives want to be taken seriously as the people with the answers and this is the best we ve got Where are our noble foundational documents our declarations our manifestos Lincoln had The Gettysburg Address Karl Marx had The Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital Hitler had Mein Kampf and we ve got what Becoming by Michelle Obama And even though I ve taken my own shot at something that might serve as a set of progressive principles and values something I call the Practopian Core Beliefs core my goal today is not really to recommend my particular set of words but rather just to point out that we are going to need something more that what we seem to have today After all we may call ourselves Progressives but in order to actually achieve any sort of real progress we are going to need something more than mere resistance to Trump and the GOP We will need something to guide and sustain us after we ve defeated the GOP unless we re eager to experience the zombie apocalypse all over again We re going to need to declare what we stand for and not just what we stand against And while equality and egalitarianism are a good start we had better find a few other things we can agree upon if we re serious about leading a modern complex society towards a greater future abortion https blogs bmj com bmj 2019 05 15 alabama abortion ban part of new efforts to restrict abortion in the united states about

Story We all participate in the willing suspension of disbelief that is necessary in order to appreciate a story that is being told 2 To Please Oneself Some beliefs are inherently pleasing to the believer the belief that I am intelligent talented and modest a belief in a just well ordered universe the belief that the sun will rise again tomorrow 3 For Personal Gain If a person or group will somehow benefit by having others believe in something the efficacy of a product or service they are selling for example then they will tend to assert that position and often to come to believe it themselves 4 To Avoid Confusion Uncertainty and Disorientation Life is a confusing business and it sometimes seems safer to hang on to any sort of opinion rather than to admit one doesn t know and to have to open one s mind to a dizzying array of possibilities As Dashiell Hammett hammett said in <cite>The Dain Curse< cite> > Nobody thinks clearly no matter what they pretend Thinking s a dizzy business a matter of catching as many of those foggy glimpses as you can and fitting them together the best you can That s why people hang on so tight to their beliefs and opinions because compared to the haphazard way in which they re arrived at even the goofiest opinion seems wonderfully clear sane and self evident And if you let it get away from you then you ve got to dive back into that foggy muddle to wrangle yourself out another to take its place 5 To Promote Social Cohesion If a group is defined in terms of a set of shared beliefs then acceptance of these shared beliefs may be a prerequisite for membership or may simply help to maintain and promote the continued existence and growth of the group As Bertrand Russell russell pointed out > Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatics to prove them This is of course a mistake If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes But if I were to go on to say that since my assertion cannot be disproved it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense If however the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books taught as the sacred truth every Sunday and instilled into the minds of children at school hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time 6 To Avoid Conflict Even if I don t believe something to be true I may accept a statement without challenge if to do otherwise would cause division and strife especially between two powerful groups This is typical of religious beliefs for example when multiple religions co exist in a shared cultural space As H L Mencken mencken said > We must respect the other fellow s religion but only in the sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart 7 As A Working Hypothesis People sometimes adopt a position as a sort of working hypothesis treating an assertion as if were true until it is proven otherwise 8 Due to a Lack of Consequences In other words saying or believing something because it can t hurt 9 As a Self Fulfilling Prophecy There are many situations in which the assertion of the likelihood of some future state of affairs may actually help to bring that state about Politicians generals and players of sports as examples are often quick to assert the certainty of their victories irrespective of their actual chances of winning to do less would not be likely to inspire themselves their teams or their supporters 10 For the Sake of Accuracy This is generally what we mean by truth if something is true then it should accurately state what has happened in the past or help us predict what will happen in the future All of these reasons for belief emphasize the importance of the scientific method science in human development develop Without a reliable method to test the truth of a proposition people will cling tightly to all sorts of opposing beliefs for all of the reasons above Note that for many people all of these reasons except the last two tend to support a belief in God It is also worth noting that all of these reasons for belief tend to be operative in the case of corporate accounting scandals scandals such as the one at Enron Of course these factors routinely come into play as part of everyday organizational life on smaller scales as well such as belief in unrealistic project schedules demarco hammett quotes thinkings a dizzy business html russell quotes the celestial teapot html mencken quotes we must respect the other

		content: "I find it fascinating to compare the original Star Trek trek television series with the first Star Wars wars movie And I think this comparison can reveal a lot about the current state of our culture The Star Trek TV series ran from 1966 to 1969 Our heroes represented the United Federation of Planets fed Their large craft was named the USS Enterprise They wore uniforms They were known by the titles of their assigned positions Captain Kirk Commander Spock Lieutenant Sulu and so on They included men and women of color as well as members of alien species who were treated as human peers They followed a written code starting with the Prime Directive prime And they were driven by a mission to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no man has gone before Individual episodes often examined various aspects of our humanity as revealed through comparison to an alien culture or to humans who had been altered through an encounter with some strange feature of the universe The signature weapon was a phaser often set to stun rather than to do any permanent damage Star Wars was released ten years later in 1977 The context for our space adventure here is not exploration but mortal combat Rebels are fighting against the Galactic Empire The Empire s large spacecraft is a massive Death Star Our heroes wear no uniform apparel They are all white skinned One of them is a loner named Han Solo The craft he pilots is named after a bird Other rebel craft are small maneuverable fighters Our heroes have no organizational titles but some of them belong to an ancient mystical order and one is a Princess Alien species are present but they are treated as inarticulate pets or as freaks rather than as peers The villain appears only in all black high tech armor that covers every inch of his skin and his lines are delivered by a black man Instead of a mission based on exploration and discovery this adventure offers the metaphysical tag line May the Force be with you And instead of following a written code our heroes seek to use the light side of the Force and avoid the dark side And the signature weapon is a light saber which generally kills or maims when used What a difference a decade made Despite some superficial similarities it s hard to imagine two more clearly differentiated space adventures Star Trek clearly emphasized the higher developmental levels devlev of 4 6 characterized by obedience to a set of shared principles a rational scientific worldview and a commitment to pluralistic diversity Star Wars on the other hand emphasized the lower levels of 1 3 characterized by a concern for individual survival a belief in magic and superheroes and ancestral stories and a focus on outcomes of power struggles between warring leaders and factions In the earlier space show a large organized federation was exploring the galaxy to increase its store of knowledge and was committed to peace and non interference in alien cultures In the later narrative the large organization had become the enemy and was committed only to increasing its power by any means necessary while the heroes were a ragtag band of hardy individuals Today it seems we in the US are increasingly living in a Star Wars sort of universe with the Star Trek worldview visible only as a distant memory in our rearview mirror Our two party political struggles appear more and more to all of us to resemble the original Star Wars trilogy with the only difference between us being that some see our current political situation as part of The Empire Strikes Back while others see it as a chapter in the Return of the Jedi Another Star Wars sort of perspective we all seem to share these days is a distrust of large institutions For those on the left of course the ones we most mistrust are giant corporations whereas for those on the right it is the deep state Where we agree is on the sanctity of the individual This mistrust of institutions is somewhat unfortunate because as far as I can see none of us really wants our human future to be a society of hunter gatherers which means that we are likely to become more dependent on our large human institutions rather than less so For those on the left the bad news is Yes we are still going to need large corporations And for those on the right the bad news is Sorry but we are still going to need big government So we might all need to take a refresher course on how to get along as part of the USS Enterprise What is it that makes so many of us distrustful of large institutions And what can we do to build and maintain support for these organizations on which our modern society depends for its continued existence Here are some principles that we should expect every large organization to follow 1 Institutions of all varieties need to be purpose driven clearly articulating and following their missions in an honest transparent and straightforward manner Just as each episode of Star Trek started with To boldly go every organization needs to pursue its own clear and concise mission with similar dedication and persistence A mission should not just be a few nice thoughts strung together in a pleasant fashion and hung on a wall when done well a mission becomes a lodestone that can be used to bring about alignment of energies within an organization as well as alignment of relationships with customers and community members Any large organization is too complex an affair to be easily understood in its entirety but those within and outside of an institution can use a mission as a shorthand for apprehending the essential points of an organization and if an organization can remain true to its mission then it becomes much easier for us to sufficiently understand and trust the institution as a whole 2 Businesses need to understand that a goal of making money does not constitute a mission similarly governmental organizations need to understand that simple perpetuation of the status quo is no part of a mission Survival is an important tactic but a mission must supply strategic guidance 3 Power needs to be distributed equitably among all involved Within the organization decisions need to be made at the lowest reasonable level and appropriate sorts of autonomy need to be available to every corner of the organization This also means that communities need to have the power to regulate the operations of organizations operating within their boundaries This also means that whenever possible customers and workers need to be free to move to competitors when they deem this to be in their best interests 4 Honesty and transparency need to be paramount Organizations and organizational leaders who are observed to tell the truth earn trust from those they lead and those with whom they do business one revealed lie depletes an institution s store of trust and makes it that much harder to replenish 5 Focus on creating value for customers and communities Every institution needs to be focused on creating products and or services that will be valued by customers and communities A mission should spell out what sort of value will be created and in what way 6 Think long term We all know how quickly things change in our modern societies yet we are all also concerned about the future welfare of ourselves those we love our children and their children An institution that is only concerned with short term results and that demonstrates a blatant disregard for our common futures will not retain anyone s trust for long 7 Rules and procedures are necessary and important but need to be subordinate to the concerns stated above Here s an interesting example How on earth did United Airlines and airport employees decide that it was right to forcibly drag a screaming innocent traveler off of one of their airplanes UA3411 And how could the United Airlines CEO respond by commending employees for following established procedures for dealing with situations like this Perhaps employees were following prescribed rules But did this somehow fit into their corporate mission Did it show any respect for the reasonable autonomy of their passengers Did they think that allowing a customer to board and then dragging him off against his will was an example of honesty Did they stop to think that their actions would be transparently viewed by others Were they actually creating value for their customers with such actions And were they considering the long term consequences of their behavior No matter what the airline s rules were consideration of any one of these principles let alone all of them should have given these employees pause before carrying out such actions Unfortunately despite mass outrage over this incident the financial performance of United Airlines did not suffer at all in the aftermath No doubt this is partly because passengers flying certain routes have little choice of carriers these days But it was also certainly because our expectations of large companies have sunk so low that even this sort of behavior could not long surprise us Such low expectations for our large institutions are not healthy for our society as a whole They force us into nonsensical positions such as citizens telling their elected officials medicare to keep their government hands off my Medicare and they allow our fears and expectations to be easily manipulated by others for their own financial gain And it is hard to imagine how problems as big as global sustainability can be effectively addressed without help from large institutions What will it take to restore trust in these agencies and return us to something resembling the Star Trek era It seems to me that we all need to raise our expectations of organizations we work with and those we work for to demand adherence to these seven principles Nothing less will really do UA3411 https en wikipedia org wiki United Express Flight 3411 incident devlev

		title: "Reframing our Debates about Capitalism",
		date: "12 Oct 2020",
    url: "blog/hbowie/reframing-our-debates-about-capitalism.html",
		content: "There is a flaw in the reasoning behind our infernal never ending society splitting debate concerning socialism vs capitalism and I want to point it out To start with imagine the lives of our hunter gatherer ancestors Notice I say our with confidence because even though I don t know who you are or where you were raised or what you look like I do know that you like all of us humans are descended from one or more tribes of hunter gatherers Our ancestors foraged off the land They did not accumulate more material goods than they needed or more than they could wear on their backs or carry with them But in general they Had developed discovered a sustainable way of life Managed to pass that way of life on from one generation to another Provided some sort of meaningful work for everyone Provided food and water and clothing and shelter to everyone Took care of each other to the best of their abilities when they became sick or frail Would you call their society an early example of socialism I don t think so Because what was their alternative After a successful hunt were they going to let half the tribe starve while half of the meat spoiled When they discovered a fresh patch of berries were they going to pass laws that prevented some of their members from eating them No of course not None of the alternatives we can dream up would make any sense They were just living the hunter gatherer life So if we look at our modern industrial society today and ask ourselves what changed between then and now between them and us you might think that the answer would be long and complicated And the details certainly are But in broad strokes there is only one essential difference Humans began to generate a surplus This started with agriculture We started growing grains and other things that could be stored for future use And before long we were growing more than we needed for the immediate sustenance of our communities And so we had to build places where the grain could be stored and devise accounting systems to keep track of who had contributed how much And as the surpluses grew our societies discovered we had enough extra energy and materials to do new and interesting things We invented written language We made reliable discoveries about the nature of the world We built factories and trains and planes and iPhones and all the rest of it But the essential idea to grab onto here is that all of this depended on our collective ability to generate a surplus more stuff than the members of our society needed for their immediate survival Without that ability nothing we recognize as modern civilization would be possible Now it turns out that the question of what to do with surplus energy and materials is a tough one There are lots of different options One person might want a new car Another might want fancy clothes And another might want to start a new business to build some new product or deliver some new service The possibilities are in fact endless But who gets to decide And how do those decisions get made This is where capitalism rightly enters the picture Because the alternative is some form of centralized planning agency that makes all these decisions for us And for any sort of modern large scale society this sort of centralized function just doesn t work very well I m reminded of the story of the Russian commissar who visited New York City sometime in the fifties or sixties who wanted to be driven around to see the lines of people queueing up to get their daily bread and could not believe it when he was told that the city had no such lines How was it possible Who was planning how much bread to bake and where it should be delivered And how were they managing to satisfy everyone without generating too much of the wrong type of bread The Russians couldn t do it via centralized planning They were pulling their hair out trying to get it right And this was just bread And before there were whole grain and gluten free varieties How would they possibly cope today And so capitalism instead of making decisions for everybody wisely allows everyone to make their own decisions about what they want to do with their surpluses But now and perhaps you re already seeing it we come to the essential flaw in our modern debates about the relative virtues of different sorts of economic systems Because capitalism is a system for making decisions about what to do with our societal surplus But what it is not and what it was never intended to be is a system for denying sustenance to any member of our society And so if we go back to the basic societal characteristics of our hunter gatherer forebears A sustainable way of life The ability to pass that way of life on from one generation to the next Meaningful work for everyone Food and water and clothing and shelter for everyone Care for the ill and the frail We have to see that these are just table stakes for any modern society claiming to offer something better than simply living off the land And frankly given the sizes of our modern human populations sending everyone out to hunt and forage is not really an option anyway These basic societal functions should be non negotiable So if our society is not living up to its minimal obligations to provide sustenance for its members and many including myself would say that it is not here in the US then is this the fault of capitalism Is it really a question of whether we throw out capitalism and replace it with socialism as so many today would seemingly have us believe I think not I think instead these are the questions we should be considering Question 1 Is it realistic to expect capitalism to be provide a complete system for managing all aspects of our society I think the answer here clearly is no capitalism is a great system for deciding how a society should spend its surpluses of energy and materials but it is not and was never meant to be a complete system for managing all aspects of our society In particular it was never meant as an excuse for leaving large numbers of people hungry and homeless and sick and for allowing children to be raised without an adequate education We cannot expect capitalism to provide the basic means of sustenance for all members of our society but we can expect society to provide a framework in which capitalism can operate while still ensuring that all of society s members have access to the basic things needed to sustain life Notice how I am framing this capitalism is not the whole of society but is a system that operates within a society Call this notion societalism if you d like or make up some other name for it but it is certainly not socialism and it certainly doesn t require us to throw out capitalism Question 2 Which societies are we talking about This is really the key debate we should all be having Because there are only two basic possibilities here A Society includes everyone living within a certain region B Societies are formed along other lines and societal responsibilities only extend to those who fall within those lines Now notice that if you go down the path of option B your notion of society can take many different forms depending on who is included All those working as employees for a specific company Everyone who shares a certain ethnic heritage All those who attend the same church or who belong to the same club Alumni from a specific set of educational institutions People who work for a specific industry or who share some specific profession All who are willing to swear allegiance to an anointed leader Now I want to be careful here you can have many different ways to group people within a society without each of those groups being called a separate society But when one or more of the five basic societal responsibilities I ve outlined above is fulfilled by such a group then it starts to become its own society And of course this is exactly what we are seeing today and see being consistently defended especially on the right health insurance provided by employers bitter legal battles over the rights of gig workers including when they should really be classified as employees thinly veiled appeals to voters based on the colors of their skin and or religions and or places of birth support for or attacks on cities and states based on whether they are run by Republicans or Democrats pensions that are dependent on union membership selections of judges based on their attendance at a small set of schools And of course above all attacks on government at all levels because those are the only institutions that could possibly be used to pursue the alternative option fulfilling societal responsibilities for everyone living within a certain region And so we have to ask what is the problem with Option B Just this it requires us to abandon our neighbors and in order to justify such an inhuman action it requires us to vilify and demonize and dehumanize those who fall outside the lines of our carefully constructed artificial societies And where does this lead To the brink of chaos just where we are today as we read the news about the FBI arresting a group of white supremacists who were poised to kidnap the legally elected governor of their state miplot Please don t make the mistake of thinking of this as an aberration a one off action by a fringe group This is where we inevitably end up this is what we find at the bottom once we start down the slippery slope of dividing up our communities along some lines other than natural geographic ones and denying basic societal privileges to those who live among us And so I think the answer to question 2 has to be this we must think of a society as including everyone living within certain boundaries and those societies must fulfill their basic responsibilities to their members Question 3 What are the specific policies we can enact in order to ensure that our societies fulfill their basic responsibilities to their citizens while still allowing capitalism to perform its intended function This is where our elected leaders need to be focusing their efforts These are hard problems to solve but not impossible ones And this is where we as citizens should be asking legitimate questions about these possible policies And yet remarkably but somehow not surprisingly our social discourse never seems to get to this stage the stage at which we might actually be able to make some real progress And why is this not surprising Because this is the real point of the endless and endlessly phony capitalism vs socialism debate that keeps getting thrown in our faces the people who feed us our daily nightmares Oh my god what happens if those lefties get elected that will be the end of capitalism and the end of society as we know it are the same people who want nothing more than to grab as much power and money as they can and hold on to it for as long as they can That s what s really behind this never ending debate Bottom Line So what have we learned 1 Every human society has the responsibility to provide five basic things to all of its citizens A sustainable way of life An ability to pass that way of life on from one generation to the next Meaningful work Food and water and clothing and shelter Care for the ill and the frail 2 A human society must include everyone within a geographic region To draw the societal lines elsewhere leads inevitably to bitter civil strife and perhaps ultimately to outright war 3 Capitalism is a means of deciding how to spend society s surplus of goods and services of energy and materials And it does a pretty good job of that if we don t ask it to do more than can be fairly expected of it I ll leave you with these thoughts for now they should be more than enough for you to ponder for a day or two miplot https www npr org 2020 10 08 921782131 6 people accused in plot to kidnap michigan governor"

    url: "blog/hbowie/rejiggering-our-religion.html",
		content: "When it comes to religion the main question for most people is whether to keep the one we were raised with or to lose it altogether I m starting to wonder though whether we re asking the wrong question I know that Karl Marx declared religion to be the opium of the masses marx but given declining rates of religious belief decline and increasing rates of opioid abuse abuse don t we have to ask might not a virtual opiate still be better than the real thing I was raised as a Christian and more particularly a Methodist but of late have tended to call myself a humanist or more particularly a Practopian But now I m starting to wonder whether instead of losing my religion altogether it might not be better just to rejigger it a bit In other words perhaps the primary question we should be considering is not whether we have religion or which religion we have but what kind of religion we have I m certainly not the only person asking this question Thoughtful Christian insiders such as Peter Wehner wehner are wondering exactly what sort of religion Christianity has become if it now views Donald Trump as its savior and defender Wehner refers to this issue as The Deepening Crisis in Evangelical Christianity crisis The United Methodists are also asking what kind of religion they have and having a hard time coming to a common answer leading to questions of whether the denomination will split over issues concerning acceptance of LGBTQ clergy and same sex marriages meth And then there s Marianne Williamson mw contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination a popular spiritual author and speaker whose voice stands outside of any traditional religious institutions Hers is not your mother s or father s religion but it certainly appeals to a large number of people who have become disenchanted with traditional churches And so as long as we re asking the question of just what sort of religion we think we should have let me give you my thoughts on the topic Here are the bits I would throw out along with the ones I would keep in OUT Beliefs in heaven and hell and reincarnation as literal realities IN A belief that our lives have meaning along with a desire for that meaning to extend beyond our individual lifespans OUT A desire for life after death as a reward for adhering to the dictates of a particular religion while here on earth IN A desire to create a better life here on earth for ourselves our friends and family and ultimately for our tribe for all humans and for all living things OUT Belief in a god or gods as beings that stand outside of nature and exert a ruling influence over our world IN Belief in powerful natural forces that have shaped our world and allowed humans and other living things to have a home here OUT Trusting that God is in charge and so everything will work out for the best IN Accepting human responsibility for our actions and their consequences OUT A belief that shared and traditional stories are best understood as literal histories of past events IN An understanding that we humans are by nature symbol creators and symbol manipulators and that one of the most powerful ways for us to experience meaning is through the construction and sharing of narratives that weave sets of symbols together into stories OUT The idea that science and scientific discoveries such as evolution somehow stand in opposition to our religious convictions IN An understanding that science represents a way for humans to gain an ever more enlightened and more empowered appreciation for the wonders of of the cosmos including our own existence OUT A belief in spirit as some independent force or energy that can exist separate from a living organism IN A respect for life and living things OUT Worship and prayer as means of showing reverence for or communication with a particular deity IN A respect for worship and prayer as forms of contemplation and dedication to a higher more inclusive more lasting sense of meaning OUT The idea that one religion is superior to all others along with the desire to convert everyone to this one right religion IN Respect for a variety of religious traditions that each offer up a rich tapestry of stories characters and practices along with a desire to spread a group of shared and complementary ethical values OUT Exclusion of some people based on who they are where they come from or what they look like IN A welcoming willingness to include all people at all levels of participation irrespective of skin color gender sexual orientation or ethnic origins OUT Building of communities around narrow unnecessarily restrictive sets of rules and labels IN Building of local conscious intentional communities based on shared goals ideals stories and traditions OUT Fundamentalist worldviews that see all social and political issues in terms of black and white right or wrong in or out us vs them in accordance with some preordained unchanging divine plan IN An evolutionary worldview willing to see social and political issues from a variety of perspectives acknowledging the need for beliefs and attitudes to adapt to changing conditions and new information while still seeking to find higher and common ground So these are the things I m looking for in a religion along with the things I d like to avoid If you look over the list of beliefs above that I d like to jettison beliefs in an afterlife in an all powerful creator in stories as literal history in spirit as an independent force in the superiority of one particular deity and one special religion preferential treatment for one group over another fundamentalism you ll notice that these are all things that serve only to divide and disempower us to pit one against another and even against ourselves These are things that devalue our common humanity in favor of other interests The things I d like to keep though a desire for lasting meaning a yearning for a better life respect for nature and for living creatures recognition of the value in a variety of contemplative practices appreciation of stories a common set of human centered values a sense of inclusive community these are things that can bring us together things that emphasize and celebrate our shared humanity If we can nudge our various religions and churches in this direction then I m starting to think we don t need to lose them altogether and might even find that they have something valuable to offer our modern world something that is otherwise missing and all too easily mislaid So if it s the right sort of religion we re talking about one with all the good bits but without all the bad parts then I don t care so much which religion it is So whether you consider yourself a Christian a Buddhist a Pagan a Hindu a Muslim a New Age believer or None of the Above that makes little difference to me I m more interested in whether you re willing to see religion as something capable of evolution and adaptation to meet the needs of our shared human fate in the 21st century So long as you re willing to do a little rejiggering to help us converge on something that works for all of us in our modern world then I think we might be on to something wehner https eppc org author peter wehner crisis https medium com the atlantic the deepening crisis in evangelical christianity

    url: "blog/hbowie/religion-storytelling-and-art.html",
		content: "Religion can be thought of as a collection of shared cultural artifacts that provide a sense of meaning about human existence Religion attempts to answer big questions such as the following Why are we here What is our relationship to the world around us How are we related to one another Religious expression can manifest itself in several different ways 1 Religion as a Shared Evolving Set of Stories In oral traditions religion would be expressed as a shared set of stories that would be passed down from one generation to another and would evolve over time 2 Organized Religion Modern organized religions differ from oral religions in three significant ways The stories are written down instead of being communicated orally The storyteller has become invisible While the role of the storyteller is always apparent for oral stories the identities and circumstances of those who originally set words to paper or who later selected and edited those words are often obscured in organized religions giving readers the impression that the written stories somehow came directly from or were authorized by a single divine source With the advent of scientific beliefs and texts the idea of a rigid unalterable truth has crept into religious texts as well In organized religions the effect of all three of the above differences has been to cause our shared stories to become calcified instead of a fluid evolving collection of stories with expected variation from one storyteller to another and with the ability to experience the stories directly and interpret them personally a written collection of stories is now accepted as gospel something that is rigid and unchanging and whose significance is not to be questioned Note that this change is unfavorable and is arguably an unintended consequence of the advent of the written word and the appearance of legitimate scientific beliefs This change is unfavorable in at least three ways the stories are not allowed to evolve to meet changing human conditions later generations are not allowed to fully participate in the role of storyteller opportunity is provided for those in power to alter the stories to suit their own ends 3 Art If religion was originally a shared set of stories that provided a sense of meaning about human existence and if modern organized religion represents a somewhat unfortunate and largely unintended calcification of some of these stories into a rigid gospel then may we not think of art as a different and perhaps even superior sort of religion That is if certain paintings poems music novels and films seem to speak to the meaning of human existence and do so frankly in a richer deeper and more contemporary manner than the gospels of organized religions then may we not legitimately refer to appreciation of these works of art as a form of religious feeling Note that such a conception of religious feeling does nothing to devalue traditional religious texts but simply allows us to appreciate them in a different context Considered in this way art becomes more than mere ornament but can be seen as a foundational element of human existence human nature html Novelist Kurt Vonnegut described his revelations on this topic in a 1974 interview http www wnyc org story kurt vonnegut breakfast champions > It s only recently that I ve come to understand that writers are not marginal to our society that they in fact do all our thinking for us that we are writing myths and our myths are believed and that old myths are believed until someone writes a new one > > I think writers should be more responsible than they are as we ve imagined for a long time that it really doesn t matter what we say I think it s a beginning for authors to acknowledge that they are myth makers and that if they are widely read will have an influence that will last for many years I don t think that there s a strong awareness of that now and we have such a young culture that there is an opportunity to contribute wonderful new myths to it which will be accepted The stories we tell ourselves give shape and meaning to our lives This is true whether the stories are passed along through personal interactions family traditions religious texts novels short stories poetry songs plays film sculpture painting or any other form of artistic expression This may be one reason why Henry Miller railed in Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch http www amazon com exec obidos ASIN 0811201074 pagantuna 20 > Men are not suffering from the lack of good literature good art good theatre good music but from that which has made it impossible for these to become manifest In short they are suffering from the silent shameful conspiracy the more shameful since it is unacknowledged which has bound them together as enemies of art and artist They are suffering from the fact that art is not the primary moving force in their lives They are suffering from the act repeated daily of keeping up the pretense that they can go their way lead their lives without art Miller speaks frankly about art with the unbridled passion and depth of conviction usually reserved for fundamentalists speaking about their religions But if certain works of art help to shape our lives and give meaning to them as many certainly have for me then does it not make sense to speak of them with this same depth of feeling usually reserved for religious texts One advantage of this form of religious feeling of course is that we know who the artists are and know they are fallible humans just like us What s more I can speak to you about my favorite works of art and tell you why they are so meaningful to me without any danger that I will condemn you if you find other works more moving than my favorites And so my form of worship is to tell you in some detail about the works of art I find most moving and to attempt to describe why they affect me so deeply http www reasontorock com"

		content: "As I watched the Biden Harris inaugural ceremonies this week I found myself overcome by unanticipated thoughts and feelings Although I ve been aware of presidential inaugurations since 1960 when I was nine this is the first one I ve ever taken the time to watch in its entirety Of course as a reliable Democrat there were the expected feelings of relief as the political pendulum swung in favor of my preferred affiliation And obviously given the armed insurrection we witnessed in our Capitol building only a couple of weeks ago there was great relief as the wheels of democracy once again seemed to engage reliably carrying us forward into a new administration even if it did require 25 000 members of our National Guard to be on hand to defend our duly elected political leaders from another attack But there was more In addition to the speakers and performers there was the unexpected comfort of seeing fellow human beings mingling together without rancor and with some joy at greeting and conversing with each other I found it especially moving to see VP Mike Pence and his wife being accepted into this gathering knowing as we do that it was only a few weeks ago that the president whom he had served loyally for four years had branded him as a traitor and set his followers upon him as if loosing a pack of dogs to hunt him down like a wild animal in the halls of our nation s Capitol And then there was the music and the poetry I m not a particular fan of any of the singers chosen but I appreciated the mix of styles and genres and backgrounds coming together to sing of our national heritage and I was moved by all of their renditions And I appreciated the inclusion of Woody Guthrie s This Land is Your Land along with the more traditional America the Beautiful And even though I don t consider myself a Christian in any sort of orthodox way I was moved by Amazing Grace speaking as it does to a univeral hope for redemption one that stretches beyond our national boundaries and reminding me of the time when my brother broke out into a spontaneous rendition of this hymn a few years back while we were celebrating his birthday in a restaurant in New Orleans And then there was the completely unexpected joy of hearing and seeing Amanda Gorman our national youth poet laureate delivering her original work The Hill We Climb on a national stage For anyone used to associating political events with empty words it was entirely impactful to hear a recitation in which every word was precisely and carefully chosen to achieve an original effect and a carefully crafted meaning But overall taking it all in together the entire gestalt for me was a feeling that our feelings and practices of humanity after being put on hold for four years could now be resumed I realized that for four long years I ve felt trapped inside a national model for human relations that knew only leading and following only domination and submission only winning and being beaten And it was not so much that I was tired of being part of one side or the other but I was just weary of living in a world where the glory and hope of humanity had been reduced to these few paltry elements And the inaugural ceremony swept me away back to the land I scarce realized we had abandoned a land in which we are happy to be connected to another just because of our shared humanity a land in which we revere this great gift of language that we ve been given and use it carefully joyously and wisely a land in which we dare to dream of a better tomorrow not just for some few of us but for all who wish to join us a land in which we each recognize our individual limitations yet aspire to greatness through our union with others a land of music and poetry and song right alongside plain straightforward speech And in sensing all of this I felt a great and much needed expansion a feeling of reclaiming something like the full breadth and depth of what it means to be human on this planet in the 21st century And because we are human I know mistakes will be made accomplishments will fall short of aspirations partisan bickering will certainly occur along with differences of philosophy and deeply held beliefs about policy But nonetheless for now I feel nothing but joy and hope and a celebration of who we are as well as who we might become And for now that s more than enough at least for me"

    url: "blog/hbowie/the-shocking-truth-about-us-liberals.html",
		content: "I can tell from my occasional conversations with friends and relatives who vote Republican that they have been thoroughly brainwashed about what we liberals stand for in the modern era So let me lift the veil of secrecy and reveal some of our deepest darkest secrets 1 We don t all agree about things Ask ten liberals a question about something and you re guaranteed to get at least eleven different answers And so when you hear your favorite right wing commentator warn you about all the terrible things liberals will do if they get elected take it with a grain of salt Especially at the national level things will tend to veer towards the center where there is broad agreement and away from the extremes 2 We don t want to run into you at the bottom of the slippery slope Many of the right wing arguments against voting for liberals run along the lines of give them an inch and they ll take a mile But guess what You can keep the mile We really don t want it We generally just want common sense moderate reforms that will make things better for most Americans 3 We re not in favor of abortions We re not anti life We want to do all we can to avoid abortions But we believe the historical evidence indicating that making them illegal doesn t make them go away but instead drives them into the shadows making them more dangerous We d rather do what we can to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place and to make sure that women and their partners receive the support they ll need should they ever find themselves in the difficult situation of having to decide how to handle an unplanned pregnancy And we ultimately support a woman s right to choose even when that results in a tragic decision to abort a pregnancy in its early phases 4 We believe in the value of hard work We re not a bunch of shiftless freeloaders who want to live off of the efforts of others We want to pull our own weight ideally with some strength left over to make life a little easier for those less fortunate than ourselves 5 We don t like mindless soul sucking bureaucracies any more than you do Whether we re talking about unions or government agencies or corporations or political parties we want to see transparency accountability sound decision making and humanity And we don t want to see corruption or self serving institutional inertia 6 We don t want to take your guns away We think guns have their place in American society Not everyone likes them but some people do and they hunt with them and practice marksmanship with them and use them safely and responsibly And America is a big country with lots of wide open spaces where guns can be used safely We don t want to interfere with any of that We d just like to see if we can reduce the chances of their being used for mass murder or for suicide or for any sort of murder actually 7 We believe in capitalism We want people to be able to make money and we think that hard working people with bright original ideas should be able to accumulate quite a bit of money so that they can continue to invest in promising new ideas from themselves and others We re not trying to drain the shark tank On the other hand we recognize that no one succeeds on their own and we think that our communities and our workers deserve to share equitably in the rewards that come from economic success 8 We don t want to throw open our borders to all comers We believe that we should enact and enforce sensible immigration policies that prioritize benefits for current US citizens while still respecting the rights and preserving the dignity of non citizens 9 We don t believe in mindless globalism We want to pursue sensible foreign policies that first and foremost are in the best interests of our country and its citizens We recognize that we have friends and allies on the world stage as well as competitors and enemies and we need to be smart enough to be able to tell one from the other And we recognize that there are opportunities for both win win strategies as well as win lose ones and we need to be able to intelligently navigate this complex range of relationships in order to produce the best possible outcomes for the US 10 We want to preserve and extend our social order We re not bloody anarchists We re not looking to overthrow anything We like law and order as much as you do We want free and fair elections We want government of by and for the people of this nation The only revolution we re interested in is the one that already happened back when we broke away from kings and queens and colonial rule 11 We believe in the rights of our states and local governments We re a big country and we re not all the same We know that what s good for a big city may not be the best for a rural area We don t want to impose a cookie cutter mentality all across our nation 12 We believe in America We believe in the words enshrined in our Declaration of Independence our Constitution and our Bill of Rights But we also believe that the unique genius of those founding documents is that they provide a sound framework for the evolution and continued progress of our great nation not shackles meant to forever bind us to conditions of the past And so we respect both the spirit and the letter of those words as guideposts and guard rails but we recognize our responsibility to continue our forward progress and to always adapt to the ever changing conditions of our modern lives It can t be one or the other it has to be both The Bottom Line Hey I know that you re a smart independent minded adult just as I am I know we won t always agree on everything When it comes to elections you and I may make different choices and I respect your decision whatever it may be But neither of us need to be scared by bogeymen fabricated by media conglomerates in order to get us to vote in their best interests instead of our own Just saying"

		title: "Some Hard Won Wisdom Concerning Cults",
		date: "27 May 2021",
    url: "blog/hbowie/some-hard-won-wisdom-concerning-cults.html",
		content: "As someone who once belonged to an organization later determined to be a cult I can tell you that the warning signs are not always obvious The members of the group I belonged to weren t living inside a walled compound or even residing together at all We weren t hiding in some remote location we gathered in the middle of a big city We didn t quit our jobs and sign over all of our worldly possessions to the organization in question We did not wear any unusual garb And we did not operate as a commune of any sort Indicators of a Cult So what attributes indicate that a group should be treated as a cult In hindsight I realized these were the telltale signs 1 Allegiance to a particular individual or to the individuals belonging to a particular family rather than to an institution an office or a set of principles 2 A set of people and or proclamations that are offered as infallible indisputable and not to be questioned 3 The primacy of this group over all others members may also belong to other groups but the group in question insists that it be the primary source of identity and meaning and guidance for its members 4 A general insistence that the leaders are the only reliable sources of truth on issues important to the group all other sources are routinely discredited 5 Assertions of truth that the followers have no way to test so that there can be no independent verification of the veracity of these statements 6 A bright line drawn between those who are members and those who are not Unlike other organizations or affiliations there are no fuzzy lines or varying degrees of gradation you re either in or you re out 7 A particular label or set of terms used to refer to those who are not members If you re in a cult then it s usually not enough to give a name to those who are members the non believers need to be strongly identified and labeled as other and less than in some definitive fashion 8 Restrictions on mingling and fraternizing with non members These may be only implied rather than stated explicitly also the group in question may offer so many opportunities for social interaction with other members that chances of forming strong attachments to non members are minimized 9 A tendency to preemptively attack the credibility of anyone who has left the fold When someone who was once in chooses to leave then the leaders waste no time in assassinating the character and history of those who have left in order to preemptively discredit any revelations or allegations that may be forthcoming What s more there will be a tendency to refer back to prior attributes or actions of the individual s who are leaving suggesting that they were never really one of us even when they were treated as such 10 Open ended expectations of members Unlike other organizations there are no precisely defined limits on the amounts of money or time that members are expected to donate the more the better is generally the rule with frequent suggestions that more sizable donations will bring the donor closer to the inner circle 11 Vaguely defined benefits for members Benefits are often alluded to or hinted at but there are few concrete promises made 12 A lack of transparency about finances and operations of the organization 13 A lofty purpose towards which the organization makes little substantial progress The stated goal helps to rally members around a common cause but the resources of the organization are often used for other more worldly purposes 14 A tendency to preemptively assign all of these same attributes listed above to the other however they are labeled thereby making it seem as if the group in question is the only way to avoid cult membership rather than what it is namely a cult itself The Tricky Bits Now you will no doubt notice that many organizations have one or more of these traits This is because most of these behaviors help to create group cohesion and in many cases such cohesion is a good thing and perhaps even necessary For example I am a proud graduate of the University of Michigan This means that I identify as a Wolverine and favor the colors of maize and blue and am likely to shout Go Blue when excited by the performance of one of our sports teams or when coming within hailing distance of a fellow Wolverine Ohio State Buckeyes and Michigan State Spartans are clearly identified as the other And judging by the number of mailings and phone calls I receive asking for donations member expectations are clearly open ended So yes we Wolverines show many of the signs listed above On the other hand the group of Michigan alumni as well as our Alumni Association and the University itself do not exhibit all of the signs listed above And so with all things considered I would not identify our group as a cult although it does exhibit some cult like traits So this is one of the ways it gets tricky because the difference between a cult and a non cult is often one of degree rather than a black and white judgment Another way this whole thing gets tricky is that many organizations start out somewhat innocently and then gradually drift or are drawn over the line into definitive cultish behavior And finally members often join a group with the best of intentions and then only over time find that their group has become a cult and they have become cult members And so when a cult is identified as such it is best not to blame the cult members or sometimes even the cult leaders It s enough just to disentangle the members we can influence from their attachments to the cult help them reintegrate into more normal society and assist them in finding new more fruitful groups with which to associate"

		title: "The Systemic Era",

    url: "blog/hbowie/the-systemic-era.html",
		content: " We tend to divide up human history into relatively neat periods and give them names like The Agrarian Era The Age of Industrialization and The Information Age When I look at what s going on around me today and try to make sense of it I am forced to draw the conclusion that we are deep into an as yet unnamed age that I would call The Systemic Era What I mean by this is that we are now at a point where the human condition is much more influenced by vast social and economic systems of our own collective making than by any natural forces or conditions or any individual actions we might take or even any individual intentions we might have Probably the best example of this is global warming the condition of increasing world temperatures and climatic instability caused by rising human population levels and human activities But just as good an example was our global financial meltdown and the controversial actions taken to prevent the failures of specific institutions from spreading and bringing down our entire credit system The problem of sudden uncontrolled and unprovoked acceleration in Toyota s Prius model prius was another typical tale of the Systemic Era Here we have a bunch of affluent well meaning environmentally conscious consumers if we dare to characterize Prius owners as such being terrorized by the prospects of the cars they are so proud of suddenly tearing off down the road and smashing into something And the cause of this errant automotive behavior A glitch in the car s software system perhaps Or a breakdown in Toyota s quality system Or a failure of our automotive testing system But whatever is causing it it certainly isn t something that you can go out into your driveway and fix with a wrench or a screwdriver even after a heart to heart talk with Tom and Ray of Car Talk fame Yet another example is the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti haiti At first global attention focused on the natural disaster and relief efforts to help residents recover from the effects of the quake But as the world s consciousness of Haiti s situation grew it became increasingly clear that there was no desirable previous state to which we could help them return there was nothing of worth to help them rebuild and in fact the deeper problems from which Haitians were suffering both before and after the earthquake were systemic problems resulting from poor economic and social policies problems that have been decades in the making And so the growing horror for the rest of the world was not so much the natural disaster and effects it had but the fact that it had taken a natural disaster of this magnitude to draw our attention to a larger problem that had been there all along and that we had been ignoring and even worse really had no clue how to solve The preeminent corporate identity in the Systemic Era is Apple Inc apple no longer a purveyor of computers they changed their name to remove that word in 2007 or even of independent isolated consumer devices but architects of interconnected systems consisting of server desktop and mobile hardware operating systems application suites its iTunes store and App Store streams of digital media from content providers and global omnipresent network connections making use of both the Internet and digital cellular networks For while products such as the iPod the iPhone and the iPad appear to be desirable objects in their own rights their individual form and styling are in some ways like the gestures of a magician meant to delight and amaze but also to draw attention away from the trick itself which in this case is the System that includes and transcends the particular device and which is the real source of value to the consumer and of increasing wealth to Apple s investors And then of course Apple is also the most self aware of its corporate influence in the Systemic Era evidenced as far back as 1983 when Steve Jobs lured CEO John Sculley away from Pepsi Cola pepsi by famously asking Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or do you want to come with me and change the world So having provided numerous examples of what I am calling the Systemic Era let me enumerate what I see as the distinctive attributes of this age 1 The presence of global human systems that are so large and powerful and interconnected that these systems and their relationships are the primary determinants of the Human Condition dwarfing the influence of Nature as well as the actions and intentions of individuals 2 A human relationship to Nature in which we are no longer subject to Nature or even harnessing Nature for our own devices but overwhelming Nature 3 Commercial motivations that see benefit more from creating and exploiting loopholes in these systems than from creating genuine value for our communities on any sort of broad scale through these systems This is the primary reason I would submit why the nature of this age is not already better understood there is little or no financial benefit to individual parties to make The Systemic Era any sort of marketing slogan as a matter of fact the situation is quite to the contrary 4 Systems that are increasingly separated from any natural or historic models to such a degree that we can no longer afford for our attitudes towards these systems to be based on any sort of historic precedents or prejudices As the Wright Brothers said when working on their pioneering aircraft wrightbros If we worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true really is true then there would be little hope for advance 5 An increasing inability for individuals and institutions to do lasting good by working within existing systems without actually changing the systems themselves or inventing new systems 6 A growing popular desire to return to simpler more natural times even though these earlier apparently Edenic times may themselves have just been arbitrary points in ongoing systemic evolution as evidenced by the now famous injunction issued during the recent US health care debate to Keep your government hands off my Medicare medicare 7 Organizational structures in human society and commerce that correlate nicely with the Integral Systemic level of human and cultural development levels as described by Don Beck Chris Cowan Ken Wilber and others So what are some of the practical implications of all this for us as global citizens Primarily I think that we should reject and see beyond some of the false contradictions continually being offered to us by the media and many of our political spokespeople First we must realize that most of the political sentiments we hear voiced today from the right or from the left are overly simplistic requests for us to attempt to return some idyllic past time and that the most pressing political reality today is for us to accept the difficulty and complexity of the time in which we actually live and to decide how to move forward from this point Second the desire to identify particular heroes and villains in the unfolding story of the 21st century is mostly a misguided waste of energy It is not the individual actors and their behavior that deserve our condemnation or approbation but rather the global human systems collectively created owned and operated that have allowed or encouraged such behavior It is on these systems themselves and their architects and not the players within the systems that we need to focus our attention Third the continued strident debate over whether we should have small government or big government misses the point A small government will exercise too little control over the systems that determine our conditions and leave these systems to be manipulated by selfish commercial interests So some sort of big government is a necessity But the big government we need should proactively and intelligently engineer these systems so as to motivate individual actors to contribute to our common good not act as a major player itself within these systems Make no mistake the Systemic Era is upon us even though we may not see it trumpeted as such on the front pages of newspapers and Web sites nor on the lips of media pundits talk show hosts and news commentators Our only choice is whether we shall embrace such knowledge and use it to intelligently fashion the systems that we live under or whether we shall leave it to other forces to determine our collective human fate global warming http en wikipedia org wiki Global warming financial meltdown http en wikipedia org wiki Financial crisis of 2007

		title: "The System is Working Very Well Thank You",

    url: "blog/hbowie/the-system-is-working-very-well-thank-you.html",
		content: "I hear a lot of talk these days about the System being broken broken And by the System I think we mean the interconnected workings of our economy our society our politics and our culture If we re not happy with the results then we need to start with a clear understanding of our current situation We need to realize that the current system is in fact not broken Instead in truth it is doing exactly what it was designed to do which is > To continuously hoover up all the spare cash of those at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid and convey it to those at the very top without the rest of us much noticing or caring The perfection of this system was demonstrated not too long ago after Hurricane Dorian blew through The Bahamas As an article in The Washington Post post pointed out the aftermath of the storm made the stark inequality of the area clear In Baker s Bay one of the Bahamas most exclusive communities celebrity homeowners were dealing with minor damage inflicted on their very substantial dwellings Over in The Mudd though an informal unregulated settlement built with abandoned construction materials on low lying flood prone ground many residents were dead missing or at best completely homeless The only problem for those residing in Baker s Bay was that all of those who actually did any real work in the area resided in The Mudd and so were temporarily unavailable to perform the minor although still important repairs to the celebrity homes In other words the major hurricane had caused a temporary labor shortage Oh well Just a minor burp in the system Because you see inequality is not evidence of a flaw in the design rather inequality is precisely the result that the system is designed to produce To better understand the system that we are currently enmeshed in let s start with the concept of surplus loosely referred to above as spare cash The ability we humans have to produce a surplus to acquire more goods than we immediately need to sustain ourselves is a fundamental attribute of our humanity It is only by having surpluses of time and energy and materials that we are able to produce tools that make us ever more efficient thus producing even greater surpluses which we use to pursue all sorts of interesting ends other than simply feeding and clothing and housing and reproducing ourselves And so it is clear that surpluses exist the mansions and other luxuries in Baker s Bay are evidence of that just as it is clear that the residents of The Mudd have no surpluses nothing available to them except the bare necessities needed for hand to mouth survival nothing put away for a rainy day and so no way of dealing with an extremely rainy and windy day when one inevitably strikes But that s one island in The Bahamas It s different in the US right There are a variety of sources with charts on wealth inequality in the US Here s one that s very instructive chart1 What does this chart tell us 1 The bottom half of our population has very little wealth and its possessions have if anything decreased from 1989 to 2013 In fact according to a recent article in Bloomberg Businessweek bloomberg The bottom half of Americans combined have a negative net worth 2 The next 40 have quite a bit more wealth and that has increased somewhat over the same 25 year period 3 The top 10 percent own the bulk of our wealth and their share has increased dramatically over the recent quarter century in question Let s stop for a minute to consider the full peculiarity of what I just said The ability to produce a surplus is one of the most basic attributes of our humanity In the richest nation on the earth fully half of our population has been able to hold onto essentially nothing zilch nada bupkis No surplus at all Could this entirely odd and unnatural result possibly be the result of a mistake or something unintentional Especially considering that by most measures our US economy is functioning well with low unemployment and rising stock prices No A result that is this thorough and complete is entirely intentional It s the result of a system that is working per its design So let me lay out the full scope of the system workings for you The percentages I ll give you are approximate but are close enough for the purposes of this narrative The bottom 10 of our society consists of the jobless the homeless and the destitute They are cared for to the minimum extent necessary by various government programs non profit institutions religious organizations and direct donations from those a little better off These are people who have fallen off of the next rung on the ladder for various reasons The next 40 of our society rounding out the bottom half consists of people working as hard as they can just to get by people sometimes working two or three jobs just to stay out of that bottom 10 They contribute to our economy by making things and performing services they make a little money then they turn around and spend all of that money on rent on car payments on food and clothing and phones and television and internet The people at this rung can t afford to save much of anything and can t afford to own much of anything They re only one emergency away from living on the streets The next 45 of our society is a little better off They re making more than minimum wage they re only working one job they re saving some money they have some investments perhaps in a 401 k they are making mortgage payments on their own home they probably own a decent car or two But they re still working for a living and likely have two wage earners in a household and probably still carry a fair amount of debt Now we get to the top 5 This group owns 2 3 of the wealth inequality in the United States At this point people no longer work for a living but live off income streams generated by their investments And this is the way the system is designed to work 85 of our society is contributing to our economy which is generating a surplus and the vast majority of that surplus is ending up in the hands of the top 5 And all the charts you can find charts indicate that this system is working better and better all the time The big boys are finding ever more efficient ways to hoover up our surplus cash Back when George Bailey was defending his father s Building and Loan from Mr Potter bailey the main focus was rent But the toolbox now includes interest rates on debt financial fees insurance payments doctor and hospital bills not covered by insurance internet service phone service music and video streaming services cloud storage app subscriptions new computers every 3 5 years new phones every 2 3 years new cars every 5 10 years new tech gadgets and the list goes on Part of the beauty of this system is that most people the top 89 let s say no matter what sub range they fall into are primarily motivated by fears of falling from their current precarious perch down to the next lower rung of the ladder Most know they have little hope of climbing farther up the ladder as economic mobility in the US has been nearly cut in half since 1940 mobility But they dread slipping down to the next lower rung and so they are motivated to continue their labors to keep their current spot in the system Over all of this hanging like the Sword of Damocles is the health of our local national and global economies For we understand all too well that if our economic engine stalls it s likely to leave us all helplessly on the side of the road And so whenever our leaders or the appointed experts tell us that we need to do this or do that or keep at it in order to prevent our economy from becoming unwell we feel that we have no choice but to obey And what keeps us from thinking too much about how the system is working How it s clearly designed to work Well we have an abundant stream of engaging entertainment that is constantly directed at us to keep us distracted social media television shows movies sports streaming music blogs podcasts a non stop multi media flow of news and opinions about the news And each of these engagements extracts a bit more cash from us either by way of direct payment or via advertising Like mice in a maze we re fed a bit of video audio text and we react We click we cheer we boo And then we re fed the next bit While all the while the system churns on working ever more efficiently hoovering up our spare cash and effortlessly transporting it to those at the top So is the situation hopeless Must we smash the machine in order to allow a new and better one to emerge Nah Not really That approach is one presented by those in power as a doomsday scenario to keep everyone in fear of unleashing the socialist furies Oh no Not that Anything is better than socialism But we don t need anything that drastic The whole problem here can be stated in one phrase how we allocate the surplus that our society generates We don t need to get rid of capitalism It s ok even necessary to continue sending capitalists a fair amount of our surplus so they can continue to invest in new businesses new factories new tools and so on But what we need to stop doing is sending them so much of our surplus In other words we need to send more of our surplus in other directions We can start sending more of it to those a little lower on the socioeconomic ladder In other words we can start rebuilding our middle class And we can send more of it to important shared endeavors such as fighting global warming We just need to find the gauges in the system that control our surplus allocations things like minimum wage labor relations law tax policies and spending policies and dial those back a bit so that a more equitable share of our surpluses are sent to workers and to communities Now the top 5 will not all agree that this is a wise thing to do And they will spend much of their accumulated wealth to try to convince the rest of us that it s a stupid thing to do And they will use scare tactics trying to convince us that if we dare to touch the dials on the machine the whole thing will stop working Poppycock That s what democracy is for That s the whole purpose of democracy So that the dials are not controlled solely by a small elite but are adjusted by the people and for the people via a government of the people It s up to us The people We just need to vote for those who are willing to put their hands on the dials and move them in the right direction apnews https www apnews com df1ca4016d27405791c10eb5772c06a4 bailey https en wikiquote org wiki It 27s a Wonderful Life

		title: "Talking Openly about Hierarchy",

    url: "blog/hbowie/talking-openly-about-hierarchy.html",
		content: "I sometimes think that at least half of the confusion we currently experience in our civil discourse stems from our inability to speak openly and honestly about the nature of hierarchy Natural Hierarchies We can all see the truth in the expression The whole is greater than the sum of its parts A word is more than just a bunch of letters and a sentence is more than merely a string of words A molecule is more than a suitcase full of atoms and a suitcase is something greater than a whole heap of molecules Molecules make up cells and cells make up organs organs work together to become functioning organisms and organisms become parts of entire ecosystems We see these sorts of interlocking holistic relationships everywhere we look both in the natural world and in our manufactured environments If we look at the relationship between atoms molecules cells organs and organisms we can readily see that they form a particular hierarchy At each level of the hierarchy something new emerges something that both includes the units present at the lower level but also transcends them in the sense of providing some new capability or function or attribute We re all comfortable and grateful for this sort of hierarchy when we re talking about living organisms or useful gadgets we would be sad if our iPhone suddenly lost its hierarchy and returned to its natural state of a pile of disassociated atoms and infinitely sadder if our pet dog was suddenly turned into a pile of dust So hierarchy is a good thing right Human Hierarchies A good thing that is until we turn our attention to human hierarchies When we start to look at hierarchies in which human beings are not the end result but merely the constituent parts then our feelings begin to diverge In particular I think liberals and conservatives tend to view human hierarchies in very different ways And I am reminded here of John Stuart Mill jsm s sentiment > In all intellectual debates both sides tend to be correct in what they affirm and wrong in what they deny In this case I believe that liberals often affirm and conservatives deny that hierarchies are used as instruments of oppression On the other hand conservatives tend to affirm while liberals deny that hierarchies are useful and necessary mechanisms for organizing human activity Armed with this perspective for example it becomes easier to see why Americans opinions diverge so strongly about NFL players who kneel during our national anthem in America nfl The more conservative members of American society seem to feel that the players should get back in line and do what they re paid to do should focus on fulfilling their roles in their chosen hierarchy liberals on the other hand tend to see kneeling as a legitimate form of protest against the oppression found in many of the hierarchies in our society The Value of Human Hierarchies Hierarchies are darned useful things In fact they re pretty much essential to the functioning of our modern society If you doubt this just think for a minute about the products and services you use on a regular basis and then consider how many companies and governments are involved in the supply chains that bring these to your door and then stop to realize that none of these organizations could function for a day without a hierarchy that allows people closer to the top to provide some kind of direction that will be followed by those below them Historically hierarchy is the form of social structure that allowed us humans to advance from families to clans to tribes and beyond Without social hierarchies we would all still be hunter gatherers hg When you think about it a hierarchy is a pretty ingenious structure Based on multiple studies Dunbar s number dunbar limits the group size a single human can directly interact with on a regular basis to somewhere between 100 and 250 individuals But what if you want to do something that will require the organization and interaction of many more than this number something like sending a man to the moon or building an automobile Well suppose you create a social organization made up of multiple interlocking groups in which each person interacts directly with peers subordinates and the group s leader This wouldn t violate Dunbar s limitation but would allow you to build much larger organizations capable of addressing more sizable and more complex tasks And that s exactly what hierarchies accomplish for us humans In fact we could barely call ourselves human without them Improving on Hierarchies For many years after humans first invented hierarchies we lived in mono hierarchical mono societies That is each human considered his or her self to belong to one and only one hierarchy As tribes evolved into clans and clans into states these were naturally formed along geographic lines and for good reason These early hierarchies were designed to fulfill two important functions organize human labor to optimize the production of goods and services within the group s territory and to defend that territory from outsiders And hierarchies have been largely successful in achieving these goals which explains why in a country like the US we ve been able to grow our human population so dramatically over the last several hundred years usgrowth Without the efficiencies developed by large hierarchies it would be impossible for us to adequately feed and house and clothe such large numbers of people In a mono hierarchical society it is only natural that each member pledge his or her unwavering allegiance to the larger group for there are no other organizations competing for our allegiance However the history of humankind did not stop with the invention of hierarchies More specifically while nothing has made them obsolete we have gone on to invent several important refinements to this fundamental social structure Multiple hierarchies In our modern society we might be part of one hierarchy at work another one or more as we participate in various religious and social activities and others as they pertain to our families So we are multi hierarchical not mono hierarchical which gives us some degree of choice about how much and what kind of allegiance we pledge to each of these Written Rules of Behavior In the original hierarchies the power of the individuals in command at each level was absolute In most modern organizations though whether corporations or countries there are written rules to be followed that limit the power of each level of command and prescribe how that power can and can t be exercised and specify the rights of members These rules help to prevent the abuse of power and to ensure that power is exercised in a consistent and productive fashion up and down the organization and throughout leadership changes These sorts of rules have existed at least since the signing of the Magna Carta mc in 1215 AD Collegial Relations between Experts Whether we re talking about craftsmen forming a guild scientists discussing their latest findings at a conference or judges conferring with one another before rendering a verdict the ability of those who are experts on a topic to discuss matters amongst themselves in order to arrive at a superior version of the truth is essential to our modern society The Pluralistic Cosmopolis As once separate hierarchies have become more intertwined and people within these hierarchies have made more lateral connections with others in adjacent hierarchies we humans have learned to live and work and love in more pluralistic societies and to tolerate and even embrace our differences It s important to remember that all four once novel social structures listed above are important supplements to our use of hierarchy to organize ourselves but are in no way replacements for hierarchy Hierarchy Today What can we say about the state of hierarchy today in both our thinking and in practice Our first observation might be that it is a terribly divisive topic If I Google the word once I get past the basic definitions I find an article from the Harvard Business Review titled Why Hierarchies Thrive hbr another from the Wall Street Journal titled In Praise of Hierarchy wsj and a third from Nature titled Hierarchy is Detrimental for Human Cooperation nature The HBR article starts by conceding that Hardly anyone has a good word to say about hierarchies And in its first paragraph the WSJ article asserts that Traditional hierarchical structures are in various states of crisis and decline And yet if you look at something like the Fortune 500 f500 you can t help noticing that a these companies don t seem to be getting any smaller and b every one of them is governed by a hierarchy In fact if you take their supply chains into account you see huge hierarchies dominating our economy And so however we may feel about human hierarchies we re certainly not in any great hurry to cast them aside If we want to be more objective about what s going on in today s world we might conclude that we are observing a power shift from religions and states to huge multinational organizations from older forms of hierarchy to newer ones not away from hierarchy at all And for those who feel they are being left behind by this shift it is only natural for them to turn to these older forms of hierarchy for help whether we are talking about criminal gangs gangs terrorist organizations terror the New Nationalists newnat or proponents of border walls Building Better Hierarchies So if we re not leaving hierarchies behind then what can we do to make sure that they serve us well Here are a few thoughts Acknowledge their worth In other words if you are participating in a hierarchy that is benefitting you and others then give it and its leaders some measure of respect while also keeping the following points in mind Make sure your hierarchy is taking care of its members If some members feel that they are not being taken care of by a hierarchy to which they have pledged allegiance or are being treated unfairly compared to their peers then they will likely revolt sooner or later This is true whether we are talking of Robin Hood the French Revolution monkeys in labs labs or voters in the 2016 US elections 2016 Ensure that your hierarchy is rule based If you don t have rules or have rules but don t follow them then you re reverting back to a feudal state such as a gang Such organizations tend to be unstable and inefficient since they are prone to internal warfare and frequent power struggles If you re looking for evidence of such problems you don t have to search for instances of gang warfare just consider the fate of the US Democratic National Committee in 2016 dnc Balance power based superior subordinate relationships with knowledge and wisdom based peer relationships There are times when decisions need to be finalized and organizational directions set These are the times to emphasize relationships up and down the hierarchy But there are other times when alternatives need to be considered and arguments and evidence need to be presented and discussed These are the times to emphasize the importance of peer relationships among those with the relevant knowledge and experience and insights Balance stability and structure with competition A hierarchy dominated by rules is otherwise known as a bureaucracy and bureaucracies tend to become inefficient and ineffective over time You need both internal and external competition between members of your organization and between your organization and others to stimulate ongoing improvements in your organizational performance Place equal value on strategic direction and situational awareness Without strategic direction set from above you can t effectively organize large groups to perform complex tasks And yet in a complex adaptive environment it is only those closest to where stuff is actually happening who have up to date first hand knowledge of what is really going on in the moment Both of these forms of wisdom are equally valuable you don t want direction from above that is so prescriptive that it precludes adjustments being made by those carrying out the strategy nor do you want those where the rubber meets the road being so disconnected from the strategy that they are being counter productive in the grand scheme of things Ensure information flows upward through the hierarchy in addition to direction flowing down from on high As noted above it is only those at the working level of the hierarchy not the executives or middle management who possess up to date first hand knowledge of how the task at hand is being performed Make sure there are routes in place for this information to make its way upward through the hierarchy to those at the higher levels And it s also good to ensure that those on high at least occasionally make direct contact with those at the working level and the work they are doing to verify that the layers of leadership in between are not missing something important in the summaries that flow upwards Maintain a distinction between the office and the individual One of the odd things about human hierarchies compared to natural ones is that we can t have a higher level unit of organization without also having a person who holds an office at that level In other words we can t have a corporation without a CEO In a human organism we understand that the kidney has a role to play but we don t have to worry about a kidney king depriving the rest of the kidney cells from getting their necessary levels of oxygen and blood flow In human hierarchies though such factors cannot be totally avoided And so we need to follow written rules about rights and benefits for all members of a human hierarchy at all levels and avoid corruption which seeks to benefit the individual holding an office at the expense of the office itself and its appointed function Always remember that no matter how large or important the hierarchy the satisfaction of the wants and needs of individual humans is still the end goal While hierarchical organizations can be said to have assets and intentions and legal rights they do not possess consciousness and so whatever goals they may fulfill these goals are ultimately only the intermediate means to a final end with that end being the fulfillment of the wants and needs of individual humans 2016 http www bbc com news election us2016 results caesar https en wikipedia org wiki Render unto Caesar dnc https www politico com magazine

		title: "Thinking about Abortion s",
		date: "21 Jul 2022",
    url: "blog/hbowie/thinking-about-abortions.html",
		content: "Along with many others of course I ve been thinking a lot about the abortion issue of late I guess I ll start these reflections with my first exposure to the procedure fourth hand as it was One of my college friends in my freshman year at Michigan https umich edu had an older roommate who managed to impregnate his girlfriend I remember the roommate was a short haired fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival which would make him somewhat of a cultural conservative on the Ann Arbor campus of 1970 His girlfriend had short hair as well I don t believe they were really prepared to become parents This was before the Roe v Wade decision and I know she traveled to California for the procedure I don t believe the trip or the procedure were a financial burden to anyone although I don t really know who paid for what My next reflection is based on a novel I happened to read recently originally written in 1963 and reissued in 2012 The Expendable Man https www penguinrandomhouse com books 214675 the expendable man by dorothy b hughes by Dorothy B Hughes is about many things but much of the story s plot revolves around an abortion taking place in Arizona The attitudes expressed in the book are telling the procedure along with the necessity for it are consistently depicted as things that only happen on the fringes of normal human society The novel is a noir and in most respects is more progressive than not for its time so I think we can take these attitudes towards abortion as fairly typical for the time and place in which the story is set And my third reflection is also based on a work of art this one a song You Can t Be Too Strong https music apple com us album you cant be too strong 299595322 i=299595335 written by Graham Parker and originally released in 1979 The lyrics https genius com Graham parker you cant be too strong lyrics also tell the story of an abortion but seen from a number of different perspectives and viewed with differing attitudes Parker later commented on the composition in a Rolling Stone interview https www rollingstone com music music news graham parker rumour becomes fact 96519 during the tour to promote the album on which the song appears > When you re sixteen or eighteen or something you haven t got any money or anything and the only thing you can think about is God I only hope she gets rid of it But I m not eighteen now and it just makes you think But when I say You decide what s wrong I m not putting any blame on a woman I m saying the fact is that a man doesn t have to decide A woman does If it s saying anyone is weak it s the men because they don t feel it The song appeared on an album with the title Squeezing Out Sparks which comes from a line in the song > Yeah babe I know it gets dark down by Luna Park > But everybody else is squeezing out a spark > That happened in the heat somewhere in the dark Later in the same Rolling Stone interview Parker further comments > A few people didn t like the title including my manager He thought What the hell is that I mean how can we market it I said I don t care It makes people think I m still thinking about what it means And in another piece https homepages uni regensburg de ~dej09534 gparker archive pinowta htm Parker says about the song > I get fairly rankled when people ask whether it s pro or antiabortion I don t deal with such simplicities It s about being involved in an event So what is my thinking based on all of this Well first of all an abortion is a procedure that inevitably brings up thoughts and feelings that are difficult to easily pigeonhole for everyone involved It s not something that we as humans are supposed to feel good about in any kind of complete or unalloyed way and no one I ve ever come across suggests it should be otherwise Second we need to get clear on our belief in the value of family planning aided by various means of contraception If we believe that it is somehow natural or morally right for every woman to produce as many new humans as she physically can or if we believe that every act of intercourse should have an unrestricted opportunity to produce a new human then we should perhaps consider the words of historian Yuval Noah Harari from his 2015 book Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind https www ynharari com book sapiens 2 > The Heated debates about <em>Homo sapiens< em> natural way of life miss the main point Ever since the Cognitive Revolution there hasn t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens There are only cultural choices from among a bewildering palette of possibilities The facts of the matter are that we humans have already traveled far beyond whatever we might deem to be natural in any kind of animalistic sense and the ethics of continuing to reproduce in large numbers when our planet is already suffering https www biologicaldiversity org programs population and sustainability population from an overabundance of members of our species are more than slightly questionable So please let s just acknowledge that for humans in the 21st century some sort of family planning through use of contraception is well within legal social and ethical norms If this is too much for you to swallow then I suggest you just take the next exit ramp off the freeway of my thinking because nothing else I say is likely to make much sense to you Once we ve acknowledged that contraceptives are widely available and morally acceptable the next step is to accept that our ethics permit us to experience the pleasures of sex without necessarily having the intent or desire or responsibility to bear and raise a new child following every act of intercourse This doesn t mean that becoming a parent is a bad thing far from it It just means that as a society we can to some extent disentangle one from the other the brief sexual act from the years of parenting at least at some times and under some circumstances Again if this is too much for you to accept then I m not sure that anything I can say today will change your attitudes on this topic and fairly certain that nothing that follows will carry much weight with you So assuming you ve made it this far let s see where we re at If it s OK for humans to enjoy sex without having children as a result and if contraceptives are not always available and are not 100 effective then there will be times when unintended pregnancies occur And so what shall we do then Now we must note here that there are two completely different categories of answers to this question The first category tries to answer this question on a case by case basis allowing the pregnant person along with their doctors and other interested parties and advisers to make the best decision they can based on the particular circumstances surrounding one particular pregnancy And I have to believe that every human faced with such a choice already feels the full weight of such a decision without any assistance from the state So I believe that society should provide them with the resources they need to make the best decision possible in their particular circumstances and the qualified medical care to safely carry out an abortion if that is their decision But the second category of answer to this question tries to come up with one universal answer that will be right for every case And here I tend to side with Graham Parker when he implies that such a stance is overly simplistic But if we wish to sincerely consider such a position then we must ask why would we say that every abortion no matter the circumstances is morally wrong Is it based on some belief in the sacred nature of life If that s your argument then I hope that you re a vegan because otherwise lives end every day so that you might live Or is it based on your belief in the special nature of human life Yes we humans are indeed special For one we are the only species capable of overpopulating the planet to such an extent that our continued existence and continued reproduction is precipitating the extinction of other species https www un org sustainabledevelopment blog 2019 05 nature decline unprecedented report at an unprecedented rate Or is your argument based on the rights of the unborn Here we enter the moral quagmire of pitting one absolute right against another Does the mother have an absolute right to decide to terminate a pregnancy occurring within her own body Or does every unborn human at any stage of development have the right to be born For me there are several considerations here 1 To refer to an embryo or fetus as having absolute rights of any kind no matter what their stage of development seems an example of extremism and an attempt to claim an absolute where none exists the truth is that human sperm and eggs and embryos experience ongoing gradual development starting with cells coming from the parents and sometimes proceeding towards a reasonably full human life there is no single point short of birth at which we can all agree that we have a human being now possessing inalienable rights 2 Every parent has a moral responsibility to care for their children to help them develop to become reasonably happy successful adults But then it follows that every potential parent has a moral responsibility to assess what sort of upbringing they will be able and willing to provide to a child of theirs And so there is an unavoidable moral calculus that every potential parent must engage in to determine whether it is right to carry a pregnancy to term and bring a child into this world There is no single right answer here especially in a modern capitalistic society in which the resources available to a child are so heavily influenced by the resources available to the parent and in which the costs of child rearing are so exorbitant 3 If we are pitting one right belonging to an adult human against another right supposedly belonging to an unborn potential human then I will tend to give preference to the rights of the adult And so finally after all of these considerations can we make a reasonable case that the state at whatever level of governance has the right to forbid all abortions and to punish pregnant persons and or their doctors for pursuing or carrying out such a treatment Frankly I can t see how such a case can be made by any reasonable caring person who understands what it means to be a responsible informed human of the 21st century If you disagree then I d love to know where I went off the track and where your beliefs and attitudes differ"

		title: "Thinking Differently About Our Economy",
		date: "24 Apr 2021",
    url: "blog/hbowie/thinking-differently-about-our-economy.html",
		content: "We all know that the economy is important We talk about it every day But do we ever think about how we think about it How we visualize it How we ve been conditioned to think about it perhaps unknowingly What I m Proposing Let me start with a pretty simple and straightforward picture of how I have come to see these things The Four Stakeholders All significant economic activity involves exchanges between four different sets of stakeholders + Consumers Those who exchange small sums of money for goods and services + Business aka Capital Those who exchange large sums of money for the tools and buildings and land and labor needed to produce goods and services in hopes of receiving some returns on their investments + Labor Those who exchange their time and effort for wages and benefits paid by business + Community The pool of environmental and societal resources that play an essential supporting role consisting of natural resources schools roads bridges power grids healthcare child care etc Now of course any one of us as an individual can participate as more than one type of stakeholder However our interests contributions and rules of governance tend to vary by type and so it s easiest to think of these as four distinct roles for purposes of discussion and analysis The Goals The goals of economists and of the policy makers through which their recommendations can be implemented must be twofold + To add value to the overall system through economic activity + To balance exchanges in such a way that all four sets of stakeholders make contributions receive rewards and suffer risks to degrees that are both sustainable and equitable The Big Picture This all seems straightforward enough doesn t it Let me restate this in three parts 1 Consumers businesses workers and communities all have their parts to play 2 When we look at the contributions each component makes the risks they assume and the benefits they achieve all four components need to be sustained so that they can remain viable contributors 3 When there are benefits achieved that exceed the levels needed for sustenance these should be distributed among all four sets of stakeholders in an equitable manner So I ve started with what seems to me a pretty simple and straightforward and meaningful lens through which we can view and measure and appraise our economic activity What We re Used To Hearing But does this sound like anything you re used to hearing I m guessing not So now let s look at our usual ways of thinking about our economy and the problems these cause Transactions between Businesses and Consumers Now one of the first things to notice is that our predominant economic thinking tends to focus first and foremost on the exchanges between businesses and consumers which is not surprising because in many ways these are the easiest exchanges to think about After all when we talk about a transaction which we often think of as the atomic unit of economic activity we are talking about an exchange between a business and a consumer that happens at a precise point in time and involving precisely defined quantities and units of measure e g this consumer purchased this number of widgets from this company on this date for this amount of money So transactions are easy to measure and easy to summarize into totals and can easily produce numbers that can be readily compared to one another Free Enterprise And when we talk about free enterprise or a free market economy we are also talking about the exchanges between businesses and consumers and stating that + Businesses should be free to produce whatever products and services they want in whatever quantities they choose and offer them to consumers at whatever prices they decide upon + Markets should offer consumers free choices between competing products and services offered by different businesses + Consumers should be free to purchase whatever products and services they decide to spend their money on And so when we think about a free market economy whose exchanges can be precisely measured and analyzed over time we naturally focus on the exchanges that happen between just two of these components businesses and consumers What We re Missing But if we stop there or if we try to force the flows to and from the other components into the free market model then we are relying on a false and incomplete picture of what is really going on Long Term and Far Reaching Effects Another reason we are drawn to focus on exchanges between consumers and businesses is that their primary effects are very local and very short term When I buy something from a business some amount of money almost immediately flows from one of my accounts to another account belonging to the business and in return a product or service is delivered from the business inventory to my residence The exchange is nice and neat and well bounded However even in this sort of transaction there can be longer term effects that are not so easily accounted for Let s suppose that the product fails in only a few months of use Or even if it continues to fulfill its primary purpose suppose the product poses some danger to the consumer or to other nearby consumers and suppose as is often the case the consumer has no way to detect these problems through a simple visual inspection of the product immediately prior to or immediately following the purchase transaction This is why some product designs and formulations need to be tested and certified before offering them for use by the general public and why we have lemon laws and warranties and other forms of consumer protection And even though there is always a natural and ongoing balancing act trying to provide adequate consumer protection while still minimizing the costs of regulation and oversight incidents such as the crashes and subsequent grounding of Boeing s 737 MAX 737 provide painful reminders of the dangerous and even catastrophic longer term effects that may occur when insufficient resources are devoted to meaningful oversight This issue of long term and distant effects vs short term and local will come up again and become even more central as we move on to consider the other two stakeholders involved in all economic activity What about Labor Now let s talk about labor We often make the mistake of seeing labor only through the same free market lens that we use for consumer transactions In other words we say that employers must compete for workers on the labor market and workers are free to choose whichever employer offers them the best work with the best job satisfaction the best working conditions the best wages and the best benefits And then when this model turns out not to work very well we think that the only solution is for workers to join together in labor unions so that they can gain the same sort of consolidated leverage that big employers enjoy And then when employees turn down a major opportunity to unionize union we all go off to our separate corners muttering under our breaths and each repeating whatever mantra we ve been taught to help explain this sort of decision But the fundamental problem is not in the details of any particular union or unionization effort but in the flawed lens through which we are seeing the problem the whole idea of free labor markets as an entirely adequate means of representing the interests of workers The basic problem with seeing labor interests only through this lens is what I will call constraints on the value of labor + Geographic constraints If a company decides to move its operations to another country or even to the other side of our country then employees will often face several sorts of barriers if they want to follow their work to the new location where it s being performed Job Market constraints As both Karl Marx and Bruce Bartlett have pointed out bigp capitalists have ways of ensuring that we never quite reach full employment levels such that there is always a reserve army of the unemployed available to take the jobs from any workers who dare to ask too much of their employers + Healthcare coverage constraints if an employee is currently receiving benefits from their employer especially for a serious threat to their health then fear of losing critical coverage may constrain their ability to move to a new job + Skills constraints An employee who has gained training and experience in one sort of job may find themselves unable to gain employment when demand shifts to a new skill set for which they are ill prepared + Lifecycle constraints a capitalist who finds his business on the rocks may decide to fold up shop at any time but an employee out of work cannot do the same unless we are suggesting self immolation when they can no longer find gainful employment The employee still has themselves to take care of and may also have familial dependents to worry about What s more most pay structures at most companies provide lower compensation for younger employees such that costs to support a family as well as sustain oneself through retirement can only reasonably be funded if an employee s salary increases over time as they gain more experience but employers are under no obligation to retain employees as their salaries grow and are free to replace them at any time with younger less experienced and less expensive labor + Automation constraints A business may choose to automate some of the work they need done replacing employees with machines but employees by definition are only paid for the hours they work and so are prevented from achieving any sorts of comparable benefits through automation + Differentiation constraints Any capitalist will tell you that one of their first goals is to achieve differentiation from their competitors in the marketplace because once a product or service is reduced to a commodity then suppliers can only compete on price which then sends all producers of that commodity off on a race to the bottom in terms of profit margins And yet all modern businesses especially large ones have implemented human relations policies with the specific intent of commoditizing their labor resources that part of the business sometimes reductively referred to as human capital + Scaling constraints One goal of any modern business is to achieve economies of scale as well as some degrees of both horizontal and vertical integration Companies do this by organizing their employees into work teams and departments and through growth And one of the benefits they can gain is the bargaining leverage they can achieve through their size Yet the typical employee has no ability to scale their own efforts or to achieve any comparable sort of leverage when bargaining with their employers except through unions And while unions can provide some welcome leverage they are often awkward and ungainly tools for achieving economies of scale or useful integration of any kind And so when we look at all of the constraints that employees are forced to operate under when compared to capitalists or consumers one has to wonder whether it is at all adequate to use a free market model as the lens through which we view the contributions they make and the benefits they receive And I think we are forced to conclude that although the free enterprise system works fairly well as a model for exchange between businesses and consumers it is entirely the wrong sort of tool to use when evaluating the role and the fate of labor So what are we implying here Capitalists in particular typically respond to these sorts of concerns with suggestions that we are trying to overthrow the entire capitalist system and replace it wholesale with socialism But this is simply not true Free markets are useful tools especially for exchanges between businesses and consumers and capital is a necessary component of our economy All I am trying to point out here is that free markets by themselves are not the best or only tool that we should use when evaluating the concerns of labor And What about Community And now we come to the fourth and final stakeholder in our economy community I am using this term to include both environmental and societal resources that are necessary to sustain our desired economic activity And here is where long term and global effects discussed above become centrally important We might once have thought that community considerations could reasonably be constrained to relatively short term and local effects But in the era of global warming and pollution of our oceans and the wholesale destruction of species ext and deforestation def and desertification desert of our land we are compelled to view community as global including other species as well as our own and to consider how such a community can be sustained in a way that it remains a viable vessel for human life and activity over a period of decades and centuries And of course these are just environmental resources we re talking about so far Just as importantly we have societal resources schools libraries parks museums theaters stadiums roads bridges power grids water delivery trash and sewage removal and so on that must be sustained in order to provide a viable framework for human life and activity over the long term And so if we found the transactional exchange of products and services through a free enterprise system to be inadequate when viewing the position of labor it proves even less useful when considering how to sustain and nurture the necessary environmental and societal resources our economy needs in order to continue operation over the long haul Moving Forward So where does all of this lead No one I think will dispute the contention that one job of economists is to help society measure the health of our economies It turns out though that economists and policymakers have been acting a bit like the drunkard searching for his lost keys beneath the streetlight drunk it s not so much that he s likely to find what he needs there but more that it s so much easier to make observations within that circle of light In a similar way when our economists focus so tightly on capitalists and consumers and free markets and transactions and stock market prices and GDP growth and inflation it is not so much because these are the only things that matter but more because they have developed such handy tools for measuring and influencing these particular numbers And also not incidentally because economists have bought into the view of the world so often held by wealthy capitalists namely that what s best for them is also what s best for everyone else This is a wonderful story especially for capitalists but it turns out not to be true rich When we focus just on capitalists and consumers we do often get rising stock market prices and lots of affordable consumer goods at least in the near term but this view of the world gives short shrift to the concerns of labor and altogether takes for granted needed supplies of environmental and societal resources So what we need and what we must move towards are economic measures and corresponding levers that allow us to pay equal attention to and have equal influence over the contributions rewards and risks undertaken by labor and by community No one should feel that such a shift in focus is a threat to capitalism and no one should allow themselves to be convinced by manipulative capitalists that giving equal consideration to the needs of labor and community will start us down a slippery slope towards socialism Here s the bottom line all four sets of stakeholders deserve a seat at the table and it should be the job of economists and policy makers to make sure that all four receive shares of the rewards that are both sustainable and equitable Anything short of this will prove before long to be ruinous for society as a whole And while we humans may take modern society for granted in the same way that fish take water we would do well to pay attention to that sucking sound at the bottom of the tank before we all find ourselves high and dry 737 https en wikipedia org wiki Boeing

		title: "A Traditional Remedy for the Facebook Problem Competition",

    url: "blog/hbowie/a-traditional-remedy-for-the-facebook-problem-competition.html",
		content: "Facebook has been in the news lately news due to renewed privacy concerns and many observers have called for various solutions including pledges from CEO Mark Zuckerberg to do better as well as increased government regulation But there seems to be an obvious and somewhat traditional remedy that is not getting much consideration good old fashioned competition Let s consider a few interesting points about Facebook 1 Facebook is one of the largest tech companies in the world Based on most financial criteria it s one of the top five US tech companies fbsize along with Apple Amazon Google Alphabet and Microsoft 2 Facebook is one of the most popular websites in the world It s right up there websites with Google YouTube China s Baidu and Wikipedia 3 It has over two billion users and is still growing In other words over one quarter fbusers of the world s population pop is already using Facebook and the company s avowed ambition is to connect even more of us across the globe 4 The company has no real competition If we consider Facebook as one social media company among many then there are clearly others in the fray Twitter Snapchat LinkedIn and a few more But if we consider Facebook as a tool for staying connected with family and friends and for storing an individual s timeline of photos and posts then clearly it stands by itself 5 It s all software Companies that sell hardware have to manage complex supply chains and are continually challenged to make their stuff more compact more lightweight and more powerful But Facebook has none of these issues 6 Facebook s technical secret sauce is negligible I say this with some reservations because operating a service as large as Facebook s is certainly a daunting task that presents many technical challenges On the other hand it s not a tough problem to put together a database system that allows users to post text and photos to identify their friends and to see what their friends have been up to lately In fact pretty much any college computer science class could put together one of these systems as a class project So sure Facebook does lots of fancy things behind the scenes to keep users engaged and to keep its customers happy but it s not clear that any of the basic ways that it adds value for its users would be difficult to replicate 7 The company s primary asset is the personal information of its users Sure it s got software and servers and lots of smart employees but that s not why people keep using it and why its customers keep paying them Facebook s treasure trove is the personal information it has learned about almost 30 of the humans on this planet 8 Facebook s business model is to help companies more effectively manipulate its users None of Facebook s 2 billion plus users pay a dime for use of the service So how does Facebook make any money It sells information about its users to companies that want to manipulate us to take some action we might not take otherwise We are all used to this sort of manipulation when we see an advertisement that is trying to get us to buy something We recognize ads for what they are We develop sales resistance Let the buyer beware and all that But all of the latest news about Facebook news2 as well as other older indications wnyc for those who were willing to look for them indicate that Facebook s business model goes far beyond traditional advertising That s the scary thing about the way Facebook works Any one of Facebook s users posts some piece of news personal or otherwise There is no review or vetting or editing of any of this content Other users like this news and share it It spreads throughout Facebook s network of friends There is no attribution no reliable source And so now we each see some piece of news that has been shared by a friend that is part of our trusted network And that news may be manipulating us to vote in a certain way not just to buy some new product or service And this news is not labeled as an ad so it bypasses all of our normal sales resistance If what I ve just described is not fairly labeled a social virus then I m not sure what would be A Unique Problem with a Traditional Solution Now if you consider the list of assertions above I think you will find our situation with Facebook is a unique one It s easy to find some ways in which Facebook is like some other large tech companies and websites but none of them share this same entire set of attributes So given the conditions identified above I think three questions naturally arise First why in the world would we want to allow this situation to continue Second what makes us think that any of this can be fixed without fundamentally altering one or more these eight attributes And third if we agree we need to improve the situation why wouldn t we start by taking steps to help open up the market to greater competition After all in a capitalistic economy this is typically our first recourse when we re unhappy with a single company s products or services let s create some competition give consumers some choice and then let the markets work their magic But what could we do to create more competition A number of steps seem possible A Break up the monopoly I said above that Facebook is unique among modern tech companies but it s not so unique if we look back a little For Facebook today is much like the old Bell System bell Back then we all used land lines to stay in touch with our friends and family Now we use Facebook The remedy for the telephone monopoly was to break up the old Bell system into a number of Baby Bells It certainly seems possible to do the same with Facebook creating a number of Baby Books if you will B Create and implement open standards I buy my phone from Apple and use AT T as my service provider But that doesn t stop me from conversing freely and instantaneously with someone else who owns an Android phone being served by Verizon How is this magic possible Through the development and application of standards that all players sign up to Similarly my primary email address is one provided by Apple and I write my emails using Apple hardware and software but that doesn t prevent me from communicating instantly with a Windows user who has an email address at Gmail Again open standards allow this to happen without much fuss So what would it take to create open standards for social media Again there is nothing about this problem that seems particularly daunting from a technical perspective C Encourage a diverse set of approaches Facebook is a for profit company that makes its money through advertising and uses proprietary software In a more competitive environment though there s no reason why we shouldn t see Open source open social media software that anyone can run for free as is the case today for the Linux Operating System the Apache Web Server and the Firefox Web Browser Non profit companies that are mission driven rather than profit driven similar to Wikipedia wiki For profit companies that charge their users and don t sell advertising such as Fastmail fm or any of the phone companies Companies that allow users to understand and even specify the algorithms selecting the content they see rather than forcing the unwitting use of secret proprietary algorithms Choice is good right And in a normal competitive environment we could expect to see options like these flourish with each user given greater freedom to choose the provider business model and features that they deem to be the best fit for them Next Steps How do we move forward here We need people everywhere to recognize the scope and nature of the problem and to demand a solution that offers a more competitive less monopolistic landscape And then we need some major players in government regulatory and standards bodies open source civil liberties and human rights groups to take this on as a cause And heck if Mark Zuckerberg is serious

		title: "The Truth About Capitalism",
		date: "07 Jan 2019",
    url: "blog/hbowie/the-truth-about-capitalism.html",
		content: "No matter which way you lean politically you probably have strong feelings about capitalism It seems to me that there are a lot of odd ideas on this topic running around out there in today s world Let me offer some thoughts about what seems true to me 1 Capitalism is not evil At its essence capitalism is an economic system that does the following things a Organizes useful work in order to maximize overall productivity b Allows individuals and organizations to freely buy and sell products and services from and to whomever they like at whatever prices they can negotiate c Generates a surplus in the form of products and services not immediately needed to satisfy the basic needs of members of society d Provides a means for storing that surplus so that it can be used at a later date e Provides incentives for individuals and organizations to invest some of their surplus not in items and services that are directly and inherently pleasing but to provide land buildings machinery and startup expenses so that labor can be employed ever more efficiently to produce better more desirable goods and services Now no particular implementation of capitalism is perfect at achieving all of these goals but this doesn t mean that there is anything fundamentally wrong with capitalism Sometimes our economic system needs a tune up or even a repair But we don t say that the internal combustion engine is fundamentally flawed just because our car is running a little rough instead we take it to a mechanic to make it operate in accordance with its design I suggest that we think of capitalism in the same way 2 Capitalists are not evil A capitalist is someone whose activities generate a surplus and who decides to invest some of that surplus in the creation expansion or improvement of various commercial ventures Without capitalists we could not have capitalism If capitalists were not motivated to achieve some reasonable return on their capital then we could not have capitalism 3 Capitalism by itself is insufficient Our economic system is an important part of our society But it does not and should not be expected to make up all of our society Even when our engine is running like a top we still need other components to put together a fully functioning automobile 4 Capitalism is too important to leave it up to the capitalists People sometimes listen to people like Warren Buffett or Jeff Bezos as if they were especially qualified to tell us how capitalism ought to work Hey these are really smart people And they have a role to play But just as Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis has said yanis that the economy is too important to leave to the economists we should insist that the running of capitalism is too important to leave to the capitalists 5 Capitalism should not be confused with feudalism When we look at a businessman like Donald Trump or a large corporation like Amazon we are sometimes tempted to think of these business leaders as if they were feudal lords and the rest of us their serfs And certainly the way some leaders operate and the working conditions at some companies and the arbitration clauses forced on workers at some companies just to name a few factors might sometimes lead us to think of our relationships along these lines But as American technologist Tim O Reilly has noted wtf > Future economic historians may look back wryly at this period when we worshipped the divine right of capital while looking down on our ancestors who believed in the divine right of kings If our economic system is treating us more like serfs than like citizens then it s probably time for a few tweaks if not a complete rebuild 6 The freedom of markets should not be regarded as absolute As Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari has pointed out yuval > In a completely free market unsupervised by kings and priests avaricious capitalists can establish monopolies or collude against their workforces If there is a single corporation controlling all shoe factories in a country or if all factory owners conspire to reduce wages simultaneously then the labourers are no longer able to protect themselves by switching jobs Free markets are generally a good thing But government has an important role to play in terms of ensuring a level playing field a reasonable balance between competing interests adequate protections against harm for individuals as well as community resources a certain level of accountability for all economic players It is entirely natural for capitalists to be avaricious it is altogether unnatural to allow their avarice to go unchecked 7 None of us should cede our entire identity to our economic role You may be a capitalist I may be a worker A friend may be a government official But these are transitory roles not assigned social classes in a rigid caste system We are all first and foremost human And secondly we are members of a common society If we cannot sit down together for a companionable meal or go watch a movie together then something is amiss 8 There is no good reason for workers to get the short end of the stick As American president Abraham Lincoln once pointed out lincoln > Labor is prior to and independent of capital Capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed Labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration This doesn t mean that every worker will earn as much as the CEO But it does mean that there is no reason for us to put up with the degree of inequality inequality that has become common today As English journalist Edward Luce has observed luce > The golden decades of the post war era bore out the theory of declining inequality But over the last thirty years that has gone into reverse During those decades the share of the US economic pie divided between labour and capital was roughly 70 30 Capital s share the flows taken up by returns on financial assets rather than wages and salaries has since risen to a level not seen since the days of The Great Gatsby The gap between the pay of the average chief executive and their employees has risen tenfold since the late 1970s to around four hundred 9 Capitalism requires compromise and balance American industrialist Frank W Abrams has noted abrams that capitalism must maintain an equitable and working balance among the claims of the various directly affected interest groups stockholders employees customers and the public at large Of course figuring out what constitutes an equitable and working balance is never easy and requires constant rejiggering And of course this is not a question that should be left to the capitalists to answer 10 Capitalists have an unnerving tendency to deplete their supply of customers Capitalists naturally want to pay their workers as little as possible because labor is an expense and capitalists seek to minimize expenses and maximize output The smarter ones however tend to realize that their workers should also be their customers so if their workers cannot afford to buy their products then something has gotten out of whack Capitalists are especially likely to fall prey to this problem if they are unduly focused on short term returns Walter Reuther the pioneer UAW organizer told the story of a conversation reuther with a Ford executive who was showing Reuther his new factory robots How are you going to collect union dues from all these machines the executive smugly inquired Reuther said he replied You know that is not what s bothering me I m troubled by the problem of how to sell automobiles to them 11 Capitalism is incomplete without a strong democracy If our capitalistic system is not working properly then our elected officials are the mechanics who must get it back in tune If they are not up to the job then we must vote them out and vote new ones in 12 The ascendance of global corporations has made the management of capitalism more difficult Most large companies today have multinational labor forces multinational customer bases and multinational supply chains Yet workers are not nearly as mobile as corporations and governments are still constrained by national boundaries This inevitably tilts the playing field in favor of shareholders and customers and against workers and governments trying to represent public interests More fundamentally the rise of global companies has muddled our very notion of society We may say that capitalism is here to serve society but when companies like Apple Google and Boeing acquire resources from all over the world farm out work all over the world and sell to customers all over the world then which of the many societies in which they operate are they supposed to be serving And who is in a position to judge if they are adequately serving the interests of society at large In such an environment there is a strong tendency to simply throw up our collective hands and allow capitalists and consumers free reign to operate without any consideration for workers and public interests This is a tendency that must be resisted 13 Human population growth also makes the management of capitalism more difficult Capitalists tend to worship growth as a supreme good More people mean more consumers more workers and greater revenue On the other hand if capitalism is supposed to meet the basic needs of all members of society then constantly increasing the size of that population makes the achievement of that goal more difficult and again as with global corporations may weaken our societal resolve to even hold capitalism accountable for meeting that goal More and more people constantly competing for a fixed or dwindling set of resources is it really worth the effort to try to divide up the pie equitably when it s so much easier just to say every man for himself and grab what you can for you and yours Again this is a destabilizing force that must be constrained and resisted 14 We need better government As I ve pointed out above there is nothing fundamentally wrong with capitalism and capitalists are just doing what they are supposed to do However it is up to our governments to establish the playing field and the rules of engagement within which capitalists operate and to enforce those rules Unfortunately capitalists seem to be much better at making money than our governments have been at helping to ensure that profits are distributed equitably In order to fix the system we don t need to vilify capitalistic principles in general or capitalists in particular We just need political leaders who will ensure that capitalists are actually doing a reasonable job of serving society abrams quotes stakeholder capitalism html inequality https inequality org lincoln quotes labor

		content: "We all have to work out the proper balance between short term and long term consequences + If I eat this cookie I will enjoy it now but regret it when I step on the scales tomorrow + If I have a few more drinks then I ll continue to have fun tonight but feel rotten in the morning + I can spend my bonus on a fun trip somewhere or I can put it in savings and know I ll have it available down the road + I can skip the rest of this story and move on to something more entertaining or I can invest five more minutes and learn something really important Making these sorts of trade offs is normal it s just part of what it means to be a human adult Sometimes we opt for the short term benefit but often judge it s more important to think of the long term consequences And what does this have to do with what s happening in Ukraine Well of all human activities war is the one that has the most catastrophic short term effects As someone who knew what he was talking about once said War is hell Which means that when one nation goes to war against another someone in power has judged that there are much more consequential long term benefits to be gained So what will be the outcomes of this war that Russia has launched against Ukraine Well death and destruction for those most immediately involved We must never forget this But then looking a little farther afield and farther down the road we can expect energy shortages and increasing fuel prices Which means that here in the US we can expect inflation to continue and perhaps even worsen for some period of time And we can expect stock markets to continue to drop In other words very real economic pain affecting a lot of people probably including you and me And we can expect politicians and media outlets to blame any and all of these events on our current governmental leaders saying that this wouldn t have happened if their man or woman had been in office But then if we look beyond these things what are the even longer term effects Why is Putin doing this Just to inflict pain on his perceived enemies What does he hope to gain I ve heard various theories advanced concerning Putin s motivation he s aging and thinking about his legacy he was there when the Berlin wall came down and wants to undo some of the perceived failures of Russia that were associated with that event he s suffering from nostalgia for an age of imperialism that has since passed us by Well all of these factors and probably more might be in play here But I m haunted by another image A couple of years ago I read an excellent book How Democracies Die by Levitsky and Ziblatt lots of good history and trenchant analysis But one passage in particular has stuck with me And it was a quotation from another author Danielle Allen who had been writing for the Washington Post about the Unite the Right Rally https www washingtonpost com opinions charlottesville is not the continuation of an old fight it is something new 2017 08 13 971812f6 8029 11e7 b359 15a3617c767b story html that had then recently taken place in Charlottesville Virginia > The simple fact of the matter is that the world has never built a multiethnic democracy in which no particular ethnic group is in the majority and where political equality social equality and economies that empower all have been achieved We are engaged in a fight over whether to work together to build such a world And what I m haunted by is the thought that the current conflict in Ukraine is just a continuation of this same fight that Allen has so perceptively identified for us For what I think Putin is fighting for is a nothing less than a world order ruled by ethnic empires with Russia sitting atop the Slavic empire China sitting atop the Asian empire and the United States sitting atop the white western European empire And so just as the rally in Charlottesville was about keeping non European ethnic minorities in their place here in the US the war now being waged by Russia is about keeping Ukrainians in their place Now so far in the short term the US and its NATO allies and many other countries appear to be united in their opposition to the Russian aggression But then of course the 2022 midterms are just around the corner in the US And our next presidential election is coming up in another two years And of course Trump and his followers are still in control of our GOP a party very much hoping to return to power in these upcoming elections And what does this party s putative leader have to say about Russia at this juncture in history Trump praises Putin trump as being pretty smart in taking over a country for $2 worth of sanctions And went on to describe Ukraine as a real estate developer might as a vast location a great piece of land So Putin understands that he and his oligarch pals and his fellow Russians may have to endure some short term pain as a result of sanctions imposed by the West But his political calculation is that he can retain power for the length of this crisis while his opponents dependent on the whims of democratic elections cannot And then once Trump and his followers are back in power the sanctions will ease and it will be clear sailing That s what Putin is banking on And if Trump and his followers regain power they will not be likely to repeat the mistakes they made in 2020 not likely to cede power again And then if that happens the battle that Allen describes will be over will have been lost We will have given in to Putin s view and probably China s view that our world order will resolve itself into one governed by a few powerful ethnic empires ruling over minorities with an iron hand for the benefit of those few but numerous groups supposedly proven by history to be superior This is the long game being played And these are the chips that are on the board to be won or lost So keep all of this in mind as you make your decisions in the coming days and years No matter what Trump might blather on about this fight is not about closing a real estate deal We are in the middle moves of a long game of chess And we are playing against a country known for its grand masters And the most pressing question for all concerned is whether a country governed by a democracy can endure short term sacrifices in order to achieve its stated ideals over the long term As Abraham Lincoln once said while surveying a vast battlefield soaked with the blood of American soldiers > It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth It s coming down to us folks Our turn to take a stand in the long arc of human history What s it going to be trump https www nytimes com 2022 02 24 world europe trump putin russia ukraine html"

		content: "When I was in school history was one of my least favorite subjects It just seemed like a bunch of arbitrary names and dates and events that I had to memorize In hindsight I realize now the problem I had with the subject was that it had been storified That is rather than trying to educate us on grand themes everything had been turned into a story certain people did certain things in a certain sequence and interacted with other people in certain ways and ended up with some conclusion Part of the problem with teaching history in this manner is that you don t end up with very satisfying stories As Shakespeare had MacBeth say It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing No wonder then that I ended up majoring in English studying Shakespeare macbeth and Faulkner At least there I could come to appreciate the stories and the storytellers on their own terms without being forced to carry the burden of teaching history as part of our shared experience The bigger problem with this storified approach to history though is that it inevitably forces historians to pick heroes and villains and to coerce their narratives into familiar patterns that then highlight these characters in customary ways No wonder then that we have to rewrite our history books every decade or so as emerging influences demand that different players be featured in novel ways to tell different stories The problem though is not that we told the wrong stories and picked certain historical figures to play certain roles but that any attempt to depict human history in this way is bound to be one sided and incomplete no matter what choices we make about the stories we tell For that after all is the nature of story as any English major could tell you And so if all of these historical stories are not the best way to understand human history then what is Hold on I m going to tell you In broad strokes all of human history can be seen as a progressive spiral made up of four intertwining strands The first strand consists of science and technology As humanity has progressed we have learned more and more about how the world works and what it can be made to do And that knowledge has accumulated over time paying dividends along the way The second strand consists of the discovery and exploitation of environmental resources The third strand consists of communication mechanisms and organizational structures As humanity has progressed we have learned new and different ways to communicate with each other and organize ourselves to accomplish increasingly difficult and complex tasks The fourth strand consists of human population growth As humanity has progressed our numbers have continually increased When I say that these four strands are intertwined what I mean is that they interact with each other in ways that make it difficult for us to neatly separate them New technology often requires the use of new environmental resources or use of existing resources in new ways New technologies and their attendant resources require us to come up with new ways of organizing ourselves Any boy scout troop can light a campfire but it takes more than a small group to build an airliner or an iPhone New technology combined with appropriate resources and properly harnessed by effective organizational structures allow us to feed and house ever greater numbers of humans on this planet of ours But then as population sizes continue to increase new technology is required in order to keep up with all of those hungry mouths And so the cycle continues its progressive spiral Trying to ask where it starts is like asking whether the chicken or the egg came first And so we have these four major forces at work behind all of human history 1 New technology 2 New uses for environmental resources 2 New means of human cooperation 3 Increasing human population levels And just about all of the stories we tell about human history reflect the interplay of these four different forces in different ways Now the sort of approach to human history that I am describing is only important if you want to understand why things happened the way they did And understanding why things happen the way they do is only important if you want to foresee or even better influence the things that might be happening to us in the future Which is not to deny the importance of stories When properly understood within the context of these great forces stories help us understand the very human impact of these forces on certain individuals and various classes of individuals And different stories can reveal different perspectives on the same events And our overall understanding is increased when we can see the same events from multiple valid perspectives And yes some stories told well can even help influence future history And yes the decisions and actions of particular individuals can make a difference in the course of human events So stories are still one important lens through which we can view human affairs Stories only fail us when we try to pick one story among many as a single and sufficient explanation of what happened to a group of humans in a particular region and during a particular period and they fail us again when we try to explain broad historical events solely on the basis of the motivations and actions of particular individuals So with that proviso let us set stories aside for the moment and return to the discussion of these four great forces that have such a great influence on the unfolding of human history Of these four intertwined forces the most familiar one is science and technology We all see and hear about new technologies and what they re doing to us or for us on practically a daily basis And this is partially because the advertising that is ever present around us is continually singing the praises of the newest products that feature the latest tech And so people make money by talking to us about technology Next most familiar is probably the discovery and novel use of environmental resources Whether you are a fan of oil or coal or nuclear energy or solar and wind you probably understand that some environmental resources need to be tapped in order to generate products and services useful to humanity Next most familiar might be human population growth although this is a force that we are rarely encouraged to consider or discuss because it is regarded as an uninteresting given something like gravity You don t find newspaper headlines screaming out how strong gravity is today for the same reasons that sunshine in Arizona rarely makes the front page And in the same way you don t see much in the news about the rates of human population growth This doesn t mean that human population sizes aren t critically important to our future it s just that we know the stories of birth and death pretty well by now So unless one of these happens in a particularly new or noteworthy way Headless Body In Topless Bar headline it doesn t get much attention Which leaves as the least familiar of these four forces to most of us the ways in which we humans communicate with one another and organize ourselves And this is where storification really gets in the way Because stories by their very nature tend to focus on individuals and their singular actions Which means that stories tend to obscure or diminish the actions of groups of individuals working together And so many of us are not really aware of differing means of social organization and how these have evolved over time and how they have influenced history But that topic is certainly worth a post of its own so I ll leave that subject for another day faulkner https en wikipedia org wiki The Sound and the Fury headline https www

biden winning election are now higher than trumps have ever been 74a59a8e5d1f If so that will be the end of the Trump presidency Unfortunately though it won t mean the end of Trumpism Many of the things that our current president came to stand for were around before his candidacy and in fact helped him to get elected and they won t simply vanish on their own If we re foolish enough to think they will then we re engaging in as much magical thinking as The Donald is when he claims that COVID 19 will simply disappear https www nbcnews com politics white house trump says he thinks coronavirus will just disappear despite rising n1232709 all by itself So what would it look like if we were to pull Trumpism out by the roots And what must we replace it with 1 A Shared Concern for the Fates of All Americans Young and old rural and urban gay and straight black and white and brown North and South and East and West the tent needs to be big enough to cover us all This doesn t mean that we will fix everything overnight But it does mean that we will share a belief that we can live in a society in which no one is left out no one is considered unworthy These are just table stakes for moving beyond Trumpism into something better 2 A Return of our Middle Class This starts with correcting the allocation of income and wealth in our society so that we are not continually making those already rich even richer https www thenation com article archive inequality wealth rich still getting richer But it doesn t end there We need good education for all of our students as well as continuing education for all of our adults We need good jobs that allow people to make valuable contributions to our society and our economy We need people with time and energy and interest in contributing to their local communities We need public spaces where people can come together for picnics and sporting and cultural events And we need people who have the time and finances to pursue their own interests It may be that the poor will always be with us and it may be that the C suite will still be around as well but we need to understand that a secure confident informed middle class is the primary source of our societal strength Along with this we need to end our worship of the rich and famous and regain respect for those who are neither on the bottom nor the top but working and living in the middle The goal of life should not be to fight your way to the top of the pile and we should not pay undue attention to those who end sitting atop one heap or another 3 An Unflinching Demand for Integrity We must demand of our leaders and our news media and our corporations and our neighbors and ourselves that we speak the truth as we know it that we are ready and willing to change our positions in light of new information and analysis that we are willing to be open and transparent with each other and that our actions are consistent with our statements We have to wind down the continued acceptance and expectation that everyone will twist and distort the facts in order to pursue their own best interests We ve seen where this slippery slope lands us And we need to get back to our feet and crawl out of this hole before we die in the darkness of our perpetual deceit 4 Mutual Respect for all of our Societal Roles The butcher the baker the candlestick maker teachers healthcare workers social workers scientists engineers farmers builders tradespeople transportation workers soldiers diplomats artists journalists police men and women accountants administrators and yes even managers all of these roles tend to require different educations and different temperaments and are needed in varying quantities But none of them are more or less important than any of the others And our society cannot function if any of them are left out And none of them should be systematically denied entry to our middle class 5 Loyalty to Principles and Values First It s great to be loyal to friends and family and neighbors and coworkers But when such allegiances conflict with loyalties to important principles and values the core beliefs need to come first We may have honest and respectful disagreements over what those ideals are and how they should best be applied to a particular situation We may need to compromise at times But we can t just throw our principles and values https practopian org core core clusters html under the bus in order to demonstrate our loyalty to a person or to a political party 6 Practicality over Fundamentalism Loyalty to principles and values is different from rigid fundamentalism Principles and values and written texts may present us with useful models for our behavior but no model is perfect We humans are first and foremost cultural creatures and our cultures are continually evolving and our modern reality is constantly throwing new challenges at us We have to be realistic and practical and adaptive as well as principled And we need to be respectful when others have different viewpoints and understand that none of us have a lock on the truth 7 Intelligent Engagement with the International Community Yes we are Americans and we need to pursue our national interests And no the right answer is not always to turn the other cheek when another country is pursuing its interests at the expense of ours But we Americans have a ton of problems that we cannot solve on our own If it s done nothing else the ongoing pandemic should have taught us that lesson not to mention the global environmental crisis https www un org sustainabledevelopment blog 2019 05 nature decline unprecedented report still threatening the futures of many forms of life on earth including our own We can only achieve the best results for Americans if we are willing to establish and maintain meaningful balanced relations with other countries and international organizations 8 Detribalization And yes finally we have to do the hard work of deconstructing the tribal divisions that have formed and hardened over the last few years and decades Yes American society is big and complex and has lots of moving parts And yes we all have different roles to play and reside in different regions and have different ethnic and cultural backgrounds and vote differently when we enter the ballot box or mail in our ballots But Lincoln was right when he said A house divided against itself cannot stand http www abrahamlincolnonline org lincoln speeches house htm And when those lines of division are as hard and unforgiving as they have become in recent years we cannot doubt that we have indeed become another house divided I ve placed this work last because frankly almost all of the earlier items need to be addressed first or at least in parallel The ever warring tribes we are experiencing today are the visible shoots and branches of a noxious weed that has taken hold in our society we won t rid ourselves of it by simply cutting down the parts we can see we need to attack the roots that allow it to continue to grow Summary By no means should we take victory in November for granted We all need to do whatever we can between now and election day to ensure that our current Republican party loses the presidency and control of the Senate And let s take time to celebrate our victory once it has been achieved But let s not celebrate for too long If this is to be a decisive victory for all Americans and not just a successful outcome to another skirmish then there s a lot of hard work left for all of us to do"

the same year that John Lennon and Yoko Ono released an album called Two Virgins https en wikipedia org wiki Unfinished Music No 1 Two Virgins certainly using the term to refer to themselves metaphorically not literally with an album cover showing the two artists completely naked Ray Davies wrote a song with the immortal line God save little shops china cups and virginity and Davies to be clear delivered this line quite seriously and quite literally A year before Jefferson Airplane released its album Volunteers delivering the injunction Got to revolution and noting that One generation got old one generation got soul Ray Davies was singing God save the George Cross https en wikipedia org wiki George Cross and all those who were awarded them https en wikipedia org wiki List of George Cross recipients Just one year after The Beatles released Penny Lane an endearing song of sentimental childhood nostalgia Ray Davies fashioned a song that used references to traditional English items and fading elements of popular culture not just for a walk down memory lane but as part of an enduring anthem upholding the value of social continuity The lyrics are a treat all on their own but the music adds a whole nother dimension to it so be sure to listen apple as well as read > We are the Village Green Preservation Society > God save Donald Duck vaudeville and variety > We are the

save Donald Duck vaudeville and variety > > God save the Village Green Note that the song exhibits many of the same virtues that it extols being itself small carefully crafted and unassuming There are a number of elements of this song that I find remarkable Its emphasis on social unity created through the repetition of the phrases We are and God save the as well as by the understated smoothly harmonizing vocals from the band members Its emphasis on critical elements of social progress preserving the old ways while still protecting the new ways Its emphasis on humanizing our society both by respect for the inexplicable quirks of popular culture as well as buildings designed for humans rather than large institutions Its emphasis on common action created through the various different types of organizations cited and even drawing the listener in through the concluding question What more can we do Thematically the song can easily be thought of as George Santayana san set to music Here are some similar thoughts from his 1906 work The Life of Reason Reason in Common Sense reason > Progress far from consisting in change depends on retentiveness When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement and when experience is not retained infancy is perpetual Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it The song seems even more relevant today than when it was first released for several reasons 1 As growing environmental issues have us all watching the Tragedy of the commons totc playing out on a global scale we can see The Kinks concern for saving the village green in a new light 2 As we see England America and other countries facing increasing polarization dividing their urban and rural populations we can appreciate the value of Davies respect for traditional village life 3 As we observe the terrible toll on our society taken by tech companies whose motto is Move fast and break things we can gain new respect for the singers avowed mission of Preserving the old ways from being abused and Protecting the new ways for me and for you Ray Davies and The Kinks certainly recorded a number of great songs but this one I think really stands alone for me It s hard to think of a comparable song from any artist that so calls upon us as listeners to knit together the splintered pieces of our society into a coherent whole that works for all of us What more indeed can we ask an artist to do apple https itunes apple com us album the village green preservation society 1142638349 i=1142638545 dan https en

		title: "Violence at the 94th Academy Awards",
		date: "29 Mar 2022",
    url: "blog/hbowie/violence-at-the-94th-academy-awards.html",
		content: "I have a few things I d like to say about the 94th Academy Awards that took place this last Sunday One thing I m not going to tell you is whether I condone violence under any circumstances I live in a society in which violence occurs daily in many forms some practiced by the state much of it shown onscreen and it seems to keep going on whether I condone it or not so please forgive me if I choose not to waste my breath on that point The first thing I do want to say is that I wish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would decide exactly who they want to be when they grow up and then put together an awards ceremony consistent with that identity I get it that they want their annual awards ceremony to be something that people actually watch and I understand that there is a long tradition of having comics emcee the show and I know that they commonly insult many of the stars in attendance because well the stars are royalty and it s always the role of the jester to take a bit of air out of the stuffed shirts And I know that not all of the jokes are going to be funny and I appreciate that modern comedy has changed even if I don t always enjoy it Still My discomfort and apparently Will Smith s seemed to start early in the show when he and other attractive male stars were invited up on the stage to participate in a quick Covid test wink wink to be conducted backstage by one or more of the female emcees I ve seen this bit described as risqué and I think it was handled about as well as it could be by the parties involved but it still seemed to me to be more demeaning than funny and I understood when Smith declined the invitation But it seemed some indication of the sort of low humor that the Academy was condoning in order to entertain as wide an audience as possible and so perhaps seemed to open the doors for the tasteless and insulting Chris Rock joke that followed a bit later And speaking of pandering to the audience as well as moral hypocrisy what on earth was the point of celebrating the 60th anniversary of the first James Bond film I perhaps could have forgiven the Academy if they had deigned to mention the original author Ian Fleming and the books on which the films were based but no it was all action sequences celebrating sixty years of the cinematic depiction of sex appeal and violence real and threatened But of course it served to send the message that the Academy knows that it s not the artsy films that pay the bills but the popular ones and these days especially the franchises And so a tip of the hat to the biggest and longest running franchise even if none of these films have ever been nominated for the Best Picture award or Best Adapted Screenplay for that matter And now finally let s talk about Will Smith walking up on stage and slapping Chris Rock across the face And because I m a University of Michigan alum and a fan of college basketball I have to say how much Will Smith s act reminded me of Juwan Howard s juwan a little more than a month ago when he reached out to strike someone during an argument following the end of a game And then both of those incidents remind me of the time when Miles Davis davis was assaulted and arrested by the New York City Police in 1959 And for me the common thread running through these three incidents is this particularly American problem we seem to have that a black male no matter what his achievements no matter how far he has come will never quite be able to enjoy the degree of respect that he has legitimately earned And so Miles Davis between sets at the hottest jazz club in America after he has already become an American icon is beaten up and then arrested by the police just because he was black and lounging outside of the club where he was performing and smoking a cigarette And then Juwan Howard I imagine feels slighted by a fellow college basketball coach and treated in a way that perhaps their white peers would not be and feels pushed beyond his limits And then Will Smith on the very eve of being recognized with the Best Actor award of being given the highest accolade the industry has to offer is expected to sit quietly and endure crass jokes made at the expense of his wife while she is sitting right beside him suffering from a malady whose physical effects she chooses not to hide from the public and being made fun of for her condition Would a white actor have been treated in a similar fashion Was it considered acceptable because it was black male on black male verbal abuse These are ultimately unanswerable questions But worth asking I think Especially for those of us who might wish to celebrate our European ancestries it is also worth recognizing that there are long traditions of using violence to defend one s honor honor and the honor of one s family and especially the women in one s family I m struck intellectually but not physically I must admit that in the cases of both Will Smith and Juwan Howard there seemed to have been no visible injuries inflicted and no apparent desire to inflict injury Rather they seemed largely symbolic acts intended to uphold the honor of those who believed themselves to have been insulted I will note that even the family friendly drama that won the Academy Award for Best Picture this year CODA contained at least one scene a barroom brawl if I m remembering it correctly depicting more violence than we saw on stage at the Oscars this year I realize that as in the case of Juwan Howard we now have to go through all the ritualistic apologies and investigations and punishments and regrets and that as much as we claim to abhor all of this violence it will consume us for a few more days as we watch and rewatch the slap as it was caught on film and all of its repercussions I just wish that events like these might also lead us to connect some of the dots to other acts of violence and racism in our society to see how these things are connected and to perhaps have a bit more empathy for the successful black men who find it necessary to act in this manner to defend themselves especially when they feel threatened while in the center of powerful institutions traditionally controlled exclusively by white males davis https andscape com features bloody police assault on miles davis feels like it could have happened yesterday honor https theconversation com honour and

    url: "appreciation/the-weight.html",
		content: "I recently came across the Playing for Change pfc Song Around the World satw video of Robbie Robertson s composition The Weight weight1 and it made me want to think and write more deeply about how this song works and what it means and the timeless nature of its appeal Let s just read the lyrics through first and listen to the music and then talk about it > I pulled into Nazareth > Was feeling about half past dead > I just need some place > Where I can lay my head > Hey mister can you tell me > Where a man might find a bed > He just grinned and shook my hand > No was all he said > > Take a load off Fanny > Take a load for free > Take a load off Fanny > And and and you put the load right on me > You put the load right on me > > I picked up my bag > I went looking for a place to

Moses > There s nothing you can say > It s just old Luke and > Luke s waiting on the Judgment Day > Well Luke my friend > What about young Anna Lee > He said Do me a favor son > Won t you stay and keep Anna Lee company > > Repeat Chorus > > Crazy Chester followed me > And he caught me in the fog > He said I will fix your rack > If you ll take Jack my dog > I said Wait a minute Chester > You know I m a peaceful man > He said That s okay boy > Won t you feed him when you can > > Repeat Chorus > > Catch a cannon ball > Now to take me down the line > My bag is sinking low > And I do believe it s time > To get back to Miss Fanny > You know she s the only one > Who sent me here with her > Regards for everyone > > Repeat Chorus One of the remarkable things about this song is that even though there is nothing about it that obviously brands it as country music or as gospel or as religious music it still manages to summon up ghosts of The Carter Family carter and that rich vein of traditional American music that sings of sacrifice suffering family and redemption There is to start with the opening verse that talks about pulling into Nazareth and being unable to find a place to sleep with its obvious similarity to the story of the birth of Christ We get extra meaning from this verse when we learn that Robbie Robertson was also thinking of Nazareth Pennsylvania as the home of Martin Guitar martin a natural destination for a very different sort of pilgrimage for a guitar player born and raised in Canada And then there are also references to the Devil to Luke to Moses and to the Judgment Day all contributing to the overall sense that our singer is working his way through a very Christian landscape And when he talks about catching a cannonball to take him down the line we understand that he is talking about a train something like the Wabash Cannonball wabash as described in an American folk song first published in 1882 Structurally the song is just about perfect in its simplicity The first verse tells us of the singer s arrival in town the fifth verse tells us of his departure and the three verses in between recount his various encounters while visiting Just reading over the lyrics one is tempted to view the song in a comic vein as one colorful character after another denies the singer s varied requests while at the same time thrusting some new unwanted companion into his arms until the singer finally decides to return home revealing that his only reason for visiting town in the first place was to convey Miss Fanny s regards for everyone From this perspective it seems to fall neatly into an American style of storytelling probably best evoked through a comparison to Mark Twain you can almost picture this as one of Huck Finn s stops on his travels down the Mississippi But in listening to the original performance by The Band apple produced by John Simon the music lends the song a whole different sense of gravitas Vocals bass drums guitar and piano all convey an earnest depth of feeling that belie any sort of tongue in cheek that might have been present in the unadorned lyrics And while composer Robertson may have been able to maintain a sort of ironic distance from his subject matter lead vocalist and drummer Levon Helm the sole American member of The Band hailing from Arkansas delivers these lines as if he had been living them his entire life And what does this music tell us The verses are delivered with a sort of plodding bottom heavy weary cadence signaling a sort of inevitability to the outcome even before the lyrics provide the details of each encounter But then there s the magnificent chorus The piano lifts us up then other voices join in to sing Take a load off Fanny take a load for free Take a load off Fanny Then the instruments pause dramatically as one two and then three voices come together a cappella singing and and and and then gradually converging to sing you put the load right on me The backing instruments then gradually descend with a delicate inchoate vocal in the background the drums kick in and we re into the next verse So what are we to make of all this thematically What do we come away with At this point it s helpful to refer to the photo titled Next of Kin that graced the back of the Music from Big Pink album cover and is shown above It was taken by Elliott Landy landy at the Danko chicken farm in Simcoe Ontario and features the members of The Band alongside many of their family members including children and grandparents If this photo had appeared on an album cover for The Mothers of Invention or some other rock groups of the sixties it would have been with a sense of irony But none of that is present here This was The Band saying this is who we are this is what we re made of this is the stock we come from this is the legacy we carry with us And it s also helpful at this point to realize that having reviewed all of the song s lyrics the title of this song simple as it is appears nowhere in those vocals So what is this Weight Well now let s treat ourselves to the video recorded to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the song video the aforementioned Song Around the World rendition And as I watch and listen to this diverse set of singers and players from all over the planet including composer Robbie Robertson and former Beatle Ringo Starr come together to perform this moving piece I can t help but feel that they are singing about our human family our next of kin bound to us by common genetics but also by a common reverence for the heritage that has been passed to us along with the responsibility to in turn pass it on to others to pass on this simple message that despite all appearances despite the daily insults and rejections we are all part of something larger sharing a common human culture one that stretches back into the past and on into the future and across the globe spanning languages and national boundaries And so this I think is why we finally raise our voices not in sorrow but in a sort of high lonesome joy accepting this weight of responsibility with all the grace that we can muster knowing that when someone we love and respect asks us to pass their kindest regards on to others we really have no choice but to do so no matter how we may be received And so just as our singer accepts the burden of carrying Miss Fanny s message even after coming to understand its full weight these players and singers from around the world seem to have in turn accepted the responsibility to carry on this message from The Band fifty years on knowing that the song is still as meaningful and true and necessary as when it first graced the airwaves back in 1968 And so finally this tremendous song joins the great tapestry one more thread to be passed down one more timeless piece of art fleshing out this idea of what it means to be human to be a member of the human family to be connected to one another by bonds both joyous and grievous May we all know

country consists of vast tracts that are still sparsely populated Looking back on our US history we can also see that some of the phenomena that once brought us together as a nation have been on the decline for some time now Consider + When the US was attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor we came together as a nation to defeat fascism in WW II + During the Cold War and the race to land a man on the moon fears of communism brought us together as a nation + Broadcast TV news as presented on our three major networks helped to bring us together as a nation as we all viewed the same images with largely congruent commentary at virtually the same time For the last several decades however + Technology has fragmented and fractured our news media + Globalization has diluted our national identity without providing any sort of cohesive new larger identity capable of serving as a suitable replacement + Starting with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1981 our federal government has often been seen as bloated unhelpful ineffective bureaucratic and guilty of massive overreach On top of all this we have the anthropological phenomenon of schismogenesis going on which I have recently learned about through the book The Dawn of Everything https us macmillan com books 9780374157357 thedawnofeverything by Davids Graeber and Wengrow This book presents multiple instances in early human times when two different societies in close proximity to one another and fully aware of each other seemed to develop in contrarian ways that can only be explained by their innate urges to just be different from those other folks And so when we look at what we think of as the partisan divide in our country we at some point may have to accept that this is not a temporary aberration some deviation from the historical norm that is bound to diminish over time simply through a regression toward the mean but a more or less permanent feature of our national identity What then + We may see more US citizens and companies voting with their feet to move to one state or another based on differences in things like abortion access + The Democratic party in particular may find itself challenged to refocus its efforts to target governorships and state legislatures rather than placing so many of its eggs in the federal basket + The forces of aggrievement that increasingly seem to power our politics may well swing in the direction of more progressive interests overturning Roe v Wade might well take the wind out of Republican sails and start to fill Democratic equivalents as women are denied abortions and forced by the state to bear unwanted children + Republicans may well find that they should have been more careful about what they wished for as their governors and legislatures become freed to do more truly stupid and terrible things and their citizens begin to take a harder look at the realities their votes have engendered and begin to experience buyer s remorse Many of us may not like what this brave new world of disarray will look like but at least for now there may not be much we can do to hold it back"

		title: "What To Do About Big Business",
		date: "02 Jul 2018",
    url: "blog/hbowie/what-to-do-about-big-business.html",
		content: "Has business gotten too big Rather than trying to answer this question directly let s start by reviewing the fundamental architecture of all modern societies The Basic Architecture Let s start with the major components Competing Interests Any modern society has to concern itself with maintaining a measured balance between a number of competing interests At the highest level these interests might be summarized as Consumers Those who make use of good and services Labor The people who work for a regular income Business aka Capital The companies that produce goods and services as well as the owners that invest in them and earn income or suffer losses from those investments Community A group that works to pool and share commonly needed resources such as roads schools and parks Conflict and Competition While these interests may at time form cooperative relationships it is also clear that these interests will often be at odds with one another As just three examples Labor might wish to increase wages whereas business might wish to lower them in order to increase profits Labor might wish for higher wages whereas consumers might like to see lower ones to make goods and services more affordable Business might wish for unfettered access to natural resources whereas a community might wish to preserve some of those resources to ensure that all community members can enjoy equal access to them The Need for Balance While these interests may at times be sympathetic to one another it is also clear that each of them if unchecked can be tempted to excess Again let me offer a few examples Business leaders may become robber barons barons taking excessive profits for themselves and impoverishing workers and communities Labor may demand higher levels of wages and benefits than can be sustained driving companies out of business or driving jobs overseas into cheaper labor markets Consumer protections may go too far placing excessive and unreasonable restrictions on business driving up costs and hampering innovation Communities may reserve an excess of resources that are only directly used by a few thus depriving society as a whole of the economic value that could be produced if business were to gain access to those resources Rights and Principles The US Declaration of Independence famously held certain truths to be self evident and certain rights to be unalienable And yet when it comes to balancing these four competing interests for the good of society there are no simple and obvious rights or principles that enjoy an equally secure footing Which is not to say that we cannot find any sage guidance Here for example are some words from Abraham Lincoln > Labor is prior to and independent of capital Capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed Labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration And here are a few words from Winston Churchill > Liberalism is not Socialism and never will be There is a great gulf fixed It is not a gulf of method it is a gulf of principle Socialism seeks to pull down wealth Liberalism seeks to raise up poverty Socialism would destroy private interests Liberalism would preserve private interests in the only way in which they can be safely and justly preserved namely by reconciling them with public right Socialism would kill enterprise Liberalism would rescue enterprise from the trammels of privilege and preference Socialism exalts the rule Liberalism exalts the man Socialism attacks capital Liberalism attacks monopoly And here a narrative from Tim O Reilly > Walter Reuther the pioneer UAW organizer told the story of a conversation with a Ford executive who was showing Reuther his new factory robots How are you going to collect union dues from all these machines he asked Reuther said he replied You know that is not what s bothering me I m troubled by the problem of how to sell automobiles to them Again though while this is all helpful advice there are no absolutes here that can be defended with the same fervor our American forefathers called upon to justify their independence Instead then what we need are a series of reasoned well informed judgment calls The Need for Responsible Governance Since conflicts between these competing interests will naturally arise and since some sort of reasonable balance between these interests must be maintained for the good of society a fifth player must be introduced a relatively disinterested societal Governing Body that can arbitrate these disputes as they emerge Natural Advantages and Disadvantages Note that each of these four interests has natural advantages or disadvantages when it comes to exerting its influence Consumers are the most numerous of the groups after all we are all consumers and so has the advantage of sheer numbers Labor typically has many more members than business and so can theoretically overpower business interests On the other hand labor needs business to supply jobs and laborers cannot easily relocate so they are generally dependent on local places of employment for their survival Communities represent all of their members and so have a theoretical advantage in terms of numbers On the other hand each separate community program often seems to directly benefit only a limited subset of the community and so it is easy for community members to wonder why all have to contribute when only a few seem to benefit When we finally come to consider business even though it has the disadvantage in terms of overall population size it has all of the following advantages 1 Organization Whereas consumers workers and communities must all build organizations in order to exert their influence in a concerted fashion businesses are already organized into large hierarchies and can simply use their existing structures to plan and execute influence campaigns 2 Resources Any sustainable business must have an income that exceeds its expenses and thus generates a surplus that can be strategically deployed as business leaders see fit including spending those resources to project business influence on society at large 3 Persuasion Any business has to persuade others to purchase its products and so businesses can easily turn these readily available skills of persuasion to influence members of society 4 Efficiency In any capitalist economy successful businesses must relentlessly focus on efficiency in order to remain competitive and stay in business consumers workers and communities are typically not subject to the same pressures at least to the same degree and therefore tend to be more prone to complacency indecision and bureaucratic inefficiencies 5 Mobility Businesses are not as geographically constrained as workers consumers or communities and so it is easier for them to walk away from deals they dislike And since other parties know this is the case mere threats to walk away from unfavorable deals give them a great deal of power as well Modern Times Everything I ve said so far has been true for any modern society of the last hundred years or so So what s new Globalization of markets has increased industry consolidation and made businesses larger than ever Apple Alphabet Google Microsoft Exxon Mobil Amazon Facebook Johnson Johnson General Electric Boeing these are all sprawling multinational companies with suppliers employees and customers all over the planet This has been good for consumers with international competition and economies of scale keeping prices low and international markets providing broad consumer choice At the same time it s made governance harder as a complicated web of authorities from different states and different localities now has to try to maintain this critical balance between competing interests These changes have also made it more difficult for workers since they ve had a hard time keeping up with ever changing skill requirements and cannot practically follow the jobs they re qualified for as businesses move these at will around their global chessboard Communities have also had a harder time competing since they are at the mercy of the rising and falling economic fates of their constituents And as environmental issues become more global and less local existing community organizations are even less well equipped to defend communal interests on such a vast scale The bottom line here is that recent developments have generally played into the hands of business leaving labor and communities in particular at an even greater disadvantage than before A Recent Concrete Example A recent story from Seattle provides a very concrete example of the forces I m describing If you re not familiar with the series of events timeline here it is in a nutshell 1 Like many booming West Coast cities Seattle is struggling with an epidemic of homelessness homeless 2 In order to raise money to help get homeless residents off the streets and into safer facilities the left leaning City Council and Mayor proposed a new head tax proposed on large employers within Seattle 3 Amazon immediately countered by ordering a halt to construction planning for a new downtown office tower thus mobilizing construction workers to protest the proposal 4 After a week of high stakes negotiations the City Council and Mayor reduced the amount of the tax and then unanimously approved the revised proposal 5 Amazon then issued a statement amazon stmt threatening to move jobs out of the city in order to avoid the tax 6 Amazon and other Seattle businesses began organizing a drive to overturn the new tax with a referendum on the November ballot 7 With other local initiatives suffering from large cost overruns government officials were hard pressed to credibly explain how they would use the new funding in an efficient and effective manner 8 Although homelessness is a problem that affects all Seattle residents in one way or another it began to appear that the city s leaders were willing to inflict hardship on all Seattle businesses and residents in order to directly benefit only a small percentage of the community 9 The Mayor and Council members found the tides of public opinion rapidly turning against them 10 Less than a month after voting unanimously to impose the new head tax the City Council quickly called a meeting to repeal that same tax and voted to ditch it by a 7 2 vote with the Mayor s blessing 11 The City Council and Mayor are now trying not only to figure out what to do about homelessness but how to salvage their credibility with both residents and business leaders So there you have it With better resources better organization better mobility and more practiced powers of persuasion business easily out maneuvers the local governing body in order to get its way and maintain the status quo leaving the community with the same intractable problem that it started with Now none of this is to say that Amazon or other Seattle businesses are evil or that the proposed passed and now repealed head tax was the right way to deal with the community problem My point rather is to point out that the playing field is not level but rather tilted strongly in favor of business no matter what the problem or what the proposal The example I just cited is one that took place recently in one of the most liberal and progressive cities in the country If we look at the US on the national level of course this imbalance in favor of business is even more pronounced Trump and Republicans and the courts are consistently favoring big business with judicial decisions with tax reforms and with cutbacks in protections for consumers and the environment Their rationale for all of this is an ideology based on the idea that when business wins we all win However as I have argued above and as history has repeatedly shown trickle the overall health of society as a whole is much more dependent on a healthy balance between competing interests rather than just giving business everything it wants and then waiting patiently for the benefits to trickle down to the rest of us So What To Do About Big Business So now let s return to our opening question Has business gotten too big In terms of size and influence I contend that indeed it has So what do we do about it In our current political climate a number of points seem clear 1 We have to rely on our legislative bodies to change the laws to restore an equitable balance We can no longer safely depend on the whims of judicial interpretation or executive orders to maintain the reasonable balance we need 2 Working top down would be nice if we could do it Reshaping international and national law reduces the ability of business to simply move its operations from one location to another and to play these locations against each other However since the largest governmental bodies the European Union and the United States are now made up of very diverse sorts of regional constituencies it is increasingly difficult to reach accord at these high levels 3 We must be better organized Businesses are already well organized to defend their interests and they will not readily yield to a disorganized rabble when it comes to their vital concerns 4 We must remember that balance is the goal Newton s third law of motion tells us that For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction We might say with comparable accuracy that every historical imbalance seems to eventually generate an opposing movement whose strength matches the intensity of the original imbalance But we need to stay focused on restoring a healthy balance not tipping things over in the opposite direction 5 There is no single magic right answer for restoring balance Increasing tax on businesses Free college education for all Free healthcare for all A minimum guaranteed salary for all citizens Forcing large monopolies to break up into smaller companies Increasing the minimum wage All of these proposals have pros and cons but none of these can be anointed as the one right way to restore balance 6 A coalition of large cities might be an effective place to start If the cities currently favored by the big tech companies were to put together some reasonable approaches that they could all agree to then that might be one way to amass enough coordinated power to achieve greater leverage when attempting to deal with the biggest businesses amazon stmt https www geekwire com 2018 breaking tax vote amazon says seattles hostile approach rhetoric forces us question

		title: "What Trump Gets Right",
		date: "11 Feb 2020",
    url: "blog/hbowie/what-trump-gets-right.html",
		content: "As we contemplate the road forward for progressives I thought it might be useful to point out some things that Donald Trump gets right This is not because I want to convince you to vote Republican but because I think it s important for the Democrats to understand the challenges they face in persuading many Americans to vote for them Before I begin I need to make clear that in this particular piece I am talking as much about positioning and perception as I am about reality For example we could have a long debate about how well our US economy is really doing and how much credit should go to Trump for what took place on his watch But that s not what this piece is about It s about how our politicians choose to present themselves to the public So let s get started If you re concerned about electability then please pay attention to how we progressives navigate a path through these seven minefields 1 The Economy Let s begin with a big one The Economy I once criticized Bruce Springsteen r2r because his song The River uses the following words > I got a job working construction > For the Johnstown company > But lately there ain t been much work > On account of the economy My criticism was based on his presenting us with a protagonist so lacking in creativity that he could blame his failures on something as remote and abstract as The Economy But I was wrong and Springsteen was right Because the average American really only knows three things about our economy 1 It s fragile and unpredictable 2 No one really knows how to keep it happy 3 When it runs amok it causes untold misery for all of us So it s basically like living with a dragon in a cave next to your village never knowing what may set it off and cause it go on a rampage destroying everything and everyone in its path In this sort of scenario any shaman who demonstrates some ability to tame the beast is going to be worshipped and even if some of his other practices turn out to be a bit questionable the villagers are not going to be in any hurry to send him packing So right now of course many of the traditional indicators of our economic health are looking pretty good in the US Unemployment is down Our trade deficit is down GDP is up The dollar is strong The stock market is up We re finally starting to see some respectable wage growth And even if people wish things were a bit better few people are brave enough to poke the dragon for fear that doing so will make things a whole lot worse Of course there are other economic indicators that are not nearly so positive Our annual budget deficit has increased and our national debt is increasing at a faster rate Income and wealth inequality in the US has been increasing over the last several decades and was only worsened by the tax reforms passed under Trump But unless the economy suddenly tanks this year the Democrats need to be careful about putting forth plans that will be perceived as poking the dragon 2 We Need People Who Can Get Things Done Unfortunately the recent debacle on display at the Iowa caucuses iowa is a great example of why people mistrust the Democrats so deeply The Dems are great at being inclusive and they re very concerned about ethics But can they actually organize effectively and get anything done Can they stop squabbling among themselves long enough to actually work together towards a common goal Can they give up their passioniate support of egalitarianism long enough to actually follow the lead of someone in charge without stopping to question them every five minutes This is why the Democrats need to be careful when they re attacking Business Yes there are lots of problems surrounding business organizations that need to be resolved But most of the hard complex work being done around the world today is being done by businesses of one kind or another and they have to do it while still balancing their budgets and making money for their owners This is why so many voters shudder when they hear the Democrats attacking Business without showing any signs that they know how to actually run a moderately complex organization themselves 3 Show Concern for Actual Americans and Not Just American Values Democrats are good at talking about upholding American values and supporting those values around the world But what about actual American people Flesh and blood Americans People who were born and raised here people who have demonstrated their willingness to work hard when jobs are available If Democrats appear to be abandoning these people as they did with Hillary in 2016 then all their fine talk about values will not not do anyone much good when 2021 gets here 4 Borders Are Still Important National borders are important State borders are important When we start talking as if immigration were a right as if we needed to celebrate every person who has ever migrated to America and open our arms to every person trying to migrate today or thinking about migrating tomorrow you re back on this slippery slope of celebrating American values without showing any concern for Americans already here This is why Bruce Springsteen s Born in the USA is sometimes used as a sort of anthem by Republicans And why one more piece written by a pointy headed liberal about how these dummies are missing the irony in the song is irrelevant The essential point to be observed here is that many Americans are seeking a champion who will look out for the interests of Americans born and raised here If the Democrats are unwilling to provide such a person then the other party will happily step up to the plate It s wonderful to be inclusive Democrats get this What they often miss is that when you are running for president of the United States you cannot afford for your inclusion to be so broad that you are including everyone in the world and you cannot afford to minimize the importance of the borders that literally define the country you say you want to lead What Democrats also miss is that even though a belief in American exceptionalism may offend some people when you are trying to persuade voters to elect you it s not a particularly good time to tell them you don t see any essential difference between your country and others around the globe or even to point out that in some ways your country may be inferior to others This is a bit like trying to get elected as team captain for the Michigan Wolverines by saying that you know those Buckeyes to the south are really a lot of fine fellows and they have a lot of great players so maybe we should just try to be more like them No matter where your allegiance lies no one wants to hear this 5 Globalization Is A Con Game Let s face it For a long time our political leaders tried to sell the American people a sort of laissez faire globalization as a win win proposition for everyone As we watched this play out though we noticed a few things 1 Living standards in other countries were on the rise while ours in the US seemed to be on the decline 2 Cheaper goods from overseas didn t do US workers any good if they couldn t find jobs 3 Lots of things in the US like healthcare and education and housing were getting more expensive not less 4 The people who were selling us all of this globalization let s just call them the global elites seemed to be getting fat and happy even though their only occupation seemed to be sitting back and passively watching all of this globalization take place 5 Other countries like China and Russia were competing ruthlessly on the international playing field for power and influence and money and resources while US leaders seemed to be acting like a bunch of drunken referees 6 Being named the Leader of the Free World is actually a consolation prize that brings with it a fine sounding title but not much in the way of ready cash You can be the Leader of the Free World and still not be able to afford a cup of coffee 6 Predictability is Not Generally Prized in Leaders Yes I understand that when you are President of the United States you have a long and complicated playbook you are supposed to follow starting with the Constitution and proceeding through all sorts of established laws and procedures and norms that have been laid down before you ever arrived on the scene Democrats get this On the other hand no one selects or long supports leaders who are boringly predictable followers This is not what leadership is about Succeeding at political leadership is a bit like writing a hit song the song needs to sound familiar enough that listeners can relate to it but contain enough novelty that they want to hear that particular song again Similarly a leader needs to satisfy certain common expectations but also needs to demonstrate their ability to think and act outside of the box 7 The National Stage is Different It doesn t make any difference what sort of political background you have it probably doesn t adequately prepare you to serve as leader of our entire nation The US is a tremendously diverse country Travel from Seattle to Texas and in many ways it s like being in a different world Heck travel from Seattle to Eastern Washington and it s a different world But at least you know where you are and can immediately see and feel and hear some of the differences and orient yourself towards them But when you are running to hold national office to represent all of our citizens no matter whether they live in Texas or Seattle or some other place with its own distinctive characteristics you can t really orient yourself geographically or culturally You need to find words and issues and concerns that will appeal to all of our US citizens or at least to a majority of them while not alienating too many of them This is why all citizens within the European Union do not get to vote to elect the president of the European Council Getting elected president of such a large diverse geopolitical entity is really tough and none of the lower level governance positions whether as mayor state governor or state senator really prepares you for a national stage Conclusion There you have it seven areas that might well make the difference in terms of whether we have a Democrat in the White House next year or have to face another four years of Trump and his cronies And please note that none of these areas require Democrats to sacrifice any of their core progressive values Nor do they require the Dems to carve up the electorate along any sort of demographic lines appealing to one group while alienating another Trump and the Republicans have tended to use these issues in harshly divisive ways but Democrats don t need to employ them in this same manner Trump won in 2016 because he knew two things better than his opponents 1 All you have to do to become President is get people to vote for you 2 When you re competing for votes as in any competition it s to your advantage to ruthlessly exploit your opponents weaknesses My hope is that we can field a presidential candidate this year who is acutely aware of these seven minefields and can navigate us through them towards victory in November

		date: "16 May 2021",
    url: "blog/hbowie/where-exactly-are-the-republicans-headed.html",
		content: "Let s first establish a little context + In our 2016 presidential election almost 3 million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump Nonetheless due to peculiarities associated with our Electoral College Trump was elected as our president fair and square + In our 2020 presidential election roughly 7 million more people voted for Biden than for Trump and Biden received 306 Electoral College votes compared to Trump s 232 What s more the Democrats achieved a federal trifecta with majorities in the House and Senate in addition to the presidency + So far Biden s approval rating is running somewhere between 53 and 60 whereas Trump s rating never cracked 45 5 during the comparable period of his presidency and his popularity never topped 50 during his entire four year term + Trump s public image has been very consistently and strongly built around an ethos of winning + By any objective evaluation Trump s presidency was mostly a failure see this summary from Business Insider bi as one example As a populist candidate he promised to help out ordinary Americans But his signature tax cuts mostly benefitted the rich without spurring any notable new investments He promised to replace Obamacare with something better but instead simply did all he could to gut Obamacare He promised to bring high paying manufacturing jobs back to America but accomplished little or nothing on this front His tax cuts increased our national debt flouting long held conservative principles Now if Kenny Rogers were still alive all of this would probably be a cue for the popular singer to deliver his signature wisdom to the Republican Party > You ve got to > know when to hold em > Know when to fold em > Know when to walk away > And know when to run So given that their aging purported winner has turned out unsurprisingly some might say to be a loser one might reasonably expect Republicans to fold their hand and at least walk away from Trump at a determined pace if not actually break out into a mad dash Now I can sort of understand Trump s position on this whole thing He maintains that the election was somehow stolen despite the lack of anything resembling evidence Well what else is he going to do Admit that he lost He s not going to get dealt a fresh hand at this point And his entire career has been built on the basis of bluff and bravado So would we really expect anything different from him Not a chance So we can t pretend to be surprised by his take on the situation But then there s the rest of the Republican Party you know the ones who recently voted to replace Liz Cheney with Elise Stefanik stefanik as the third ranking member of their leadership all because Cheney dared to state that their presidential candidate had actually lost the election Fair and square So where do these Republicans think that all of this denial is leading them Do they really have some sort of long term strategy It sure doesn t seem like it Instead they seem to be acting like some species of laboratory rodent that has been conditioned to expect a treat every time they press the big red MAGA button and they are just not ready to believe that the experiment is over and the treats are running out Of course recent numbers indicate that those supporting the Big Lie are still receiving a fair number of treats in terms of campaign donations from outraged Trump supporters so in that sense I suppose they are continuing to milk it for all it s worth But if we look a little farther down the road where are they headed The modern Republican con game certainly didn t start with Trump but it seems likely to end with him Back in the Reagan days the con was pretty sophisticated and pretty convincing cut taxes for the rich and the benefits will trickle down to the rest of us shrink the size of the federal government and we will all feel our burdens lifted unshackle the hands of capitalists and they will continue the American tradition of innovation delivering untold riches to our doorsteps loose the engines of free enterprise and the rest of the world will surely follow the path to prosperity that we have blazed for them get rid of the bad guys and create safety and freedom for the rest of us throw some carrots to blacks and minorities every once in a while but leave the white guys to rule the roost place our trust in paternalistic father figures and be guided by their wisdom But by the time Trump came along this long con had pretty much been played out it seemed a bit threadbare and no longer very convincing But then Trump breathed new life into it by taking it farther than anyone had thought possible He simplified it and removed any constraints to mere facts or even any pretense to sanity and reason And buttressed by the extraordinary success of Fox News and other right wing media outlets and social media giants hungry for any sort of sticky engagement Trump was able to stretch the con out for four more years to everyone s surprise including his own But by the time 2020 rolled along even Trump couldn t keep a majority of the marks fooled any longer By this point too many Americans realized that + Tax cuts for the wealthy just make the rich even richer without materially improving the lots of the rest of us + Our federal government actually has an important role to play especially when faced with challenges as large as a global pandemic and global warming and species extinction + Capitalism and capitalists can truly deliver amazing innovations that improve society but this is no reason to let them run amok without any guard rails to protect workers consumers and communities + In a world of growing populations and increasingly scarce and valuable pools of resources authoritarian regimes and oligarchies can easily spring up and be hard to dislodge + If our society provides too few opportunities for citizens to reach the middle class restricting upward mobility especially for minorities and the disadvantaged then we will soon find that imprisoning the bad guys has become a growth industry that benefits no one except the owners of private prisons + Our country s largest and most successful corporations are increasingly built on knowledge work and these sorts of businesses have to embrace diversity and inclusion in order to attract and retain both employees and customers + Not all aging white American males have our best interests at heart let alone the knowledge and intelligence needed to run a country So how are the Republicans dealing with all of this growing awareness I m reminded of a quote from Kurt Vonnegut s book Mother Night > We are what we pretend to be so we must be careful about what we pretend to be It seems that many Republican politicians started out by only pretending to be witless but enthusiastic supporters of Donald Trump but then as Vonnegut foretold they were transformed into the very things they were only pretending to be So now they seem doomed to act like some strange variety of lemmings unable to turn back from the cliff after their leader has jumped but unable to turn away And so they spend every day of their lives dancing along the edge trying to convince the rest of us how good life will be at the bottom I don t know about you but I m ready for the rest of them to take the plunge and make way for whatever

    url: "blog/hbowie/why-do-we-call-it-capitalism.html",
		content: "As Americans we generally believe in capitalism as a superior economic system and are typically convinced that our country is run on capitalistic principles But I ve been wondering lately If these things are really true then why do so few Americans actually possess any capital ineq If we really believe that the means of production should be owned by ordinary citizens and not by our government then why is it that the bulk of our country s capital is owned by so few of us nyt It makes for an odd picture it s as if we were all strongly convinced of our right to gamble and were all living in Las Vegas and every one of us going out to the casinos every night after work but only a few of us being given any chips Instead we seem to spend our free time on Facebook telling each other how wonderful it is to live in a country where we all have the right to gamble and then being forced to earn a living by cleaning the ashtrays US Wealth Distribution Perception vs Reality images us wealth distribution perception jpg Of course one of the wonderful things about capitalism is that it s supposed to be an economic meritocracy in which everyone gets to compete in free and open markets and the cream is allowed to rise to the top in terms of the best products and services and companies and workers But again I ve been wondering lately if we believe so strongly in fair competition then why don t all of our citizens get equal starts in life Again it makes for an odd picture it s like going to the horse races only to see a few large and noble steeds competing against some old mares and broken down drays that have been hauling the milk trucks Of course it makes it all the more exciting when there s a surprise upset when some lowly newcomer beats the odds shelby but wouldn t it be more in line with capitalist principles if everyone got a fair start https news harvard edu gazette story 2016 02 the costs of inequality educations the one key that rules them all Comparative Science and Reading Scores in Eighth Grade images science reading scores png And once more I ve been struck by another question if we believe so strongly in competition then why are there so few competitors cap myth Why are so many of our markets dominated by near monopolies or small oligopolies in which a few large companies divvy up a large and profitable market between themselves And then to go a step further why are so many of the markets themselves owned by large monopolies generating huge profits for a few owners For if truth be told Amazon is little more than a marketplace for products and Facebook is nothing but a marketplace for ideas and news and Comcast is a marketplace for network packets Again it s an odd image it s as if there were only two teams in the NFL and the only game being played was the Super Bowl and the two teams just took turns winning every year I m not sure many fans would consider that sort of an arrangement to be much of a competition And so if what we have is not really capitalism at all or is at best a very odd and lopsided and perhaps even downright ugly sort of capitalism then what is it exactly that we Americans do have If we re to call it fairly what it is I think we would describe it as a nationalized system of sharecropping or of debt bondage db As Merle Travis mt wrote back in 1946 using actual lines spoken or written by his brother and father based on their experiences working as coal miners > You load Sixteen Tons 16t and what do you get > Another day older and deeper in debt > St Peter don t you call me cause I can t go > I owe my soul to the company store This is a wonderful system for those few who actually own the mines or the factories or the fields and for those who inherit these things from their forebears everyone else does all the work and the owners allow the workers to keep just enough to stay alive but not so much that they don t bother showing up for work the next day As Robert Hunter wrote and the Grateful Dead sang in Cumberland Blues cb > Make good money five dollars a day > If I made any more I might move away No wonder then that even though the first instruction given by every financial planner in the country is to keep six months of your salary in savings for an emergency when an actual emergency strikes most of our workers almost immediately lack enough cash to buy groceries or pay their rent rent And so I am forced to conclude what we have in place of capitalism is a sort of caste system made up of the following 1 The owners who hold the deeds to the land the factories the fields and the mines and who reap all of the profits from the entire system 2 The managers who act as intermediaries between the owners and the workers I include here the project managers and the program managers and the finance managers and the programmers who perform the same function but with machines as their underlings This caste is allowed to live comfortably and to accumulate some token amounts of capital 3 The workers who perform the actual labor that cannot be done more cheaply by machines and who own nothing outright 4 The homeless who own nothing to speak of and who have no sources of stable income This class includes those living on the streets as well as migrant workers and those living in jails But wait a minute I hear you say don t we Americans live in a democracy Didn t our ancestors come to the New World to escape kings and dukes and such How could an alleged class system such as this perpetuate itself in the land of the free Well as it turns out there are ways to make this work As a matter of fact there are even advantages to having a democratic seeming sort of caste hierarchy Because privilege is not strictly based on heredity and power is not strictly based on privilege there is little for the underclasses to resent or revolt against The managerial class is easily controlled because they are given just enough capital and privilege and access to make them feel sympathetic towards the owners Since the owners control the mass media the news and entertainment provided to the underclasses can be used to manipulate and control their beliefs and feelings and hence their actions The workers are kept busy working and having babies and buying things and making loan payments and being entertained and so they lack the time and energy to educate themselves about how the system works or to organize themselves enough to change the system The homeless class is not sizable enough to have any power but is large and visible enough to remind the workers that no matter how bad off they might feel it could always be worse so they had better be grateful for what they do have And so to come back to the question I asked at the start can we properly refer to this sort of system as capitalism My answer is no I think it would be more accurate to call it a sort of sham capitalism a cheap knock off like one of those things you sometimes end up ordering on Amazon at a price that was too good to be true If we want real capitalism by which I mean a market economy that actually optimizes outcomes for most members of society then we will have to pay the true price for such a valuable beast We will have to invest in better government and improved infrastructure and the education of all our children and we will have to give our workers a healthy share of the capital in our society and we will have to give them enough real freedom in the form of free time and free information to become better educated and make better choices for themselves for their families and for the civic institutions that are entrusted to act in their interests So let s not be confused by the false dichotomy continually being presented to us these days it s not a question of capitalism vs socialism with the term Socialism being used as a bogeyman to scare us all back to our respective places in the established caste system Instead it s a question of sham capitalism vs a real and functional capitalism that might actually do what most of us expect it to do to engage the vast majority of us as members of a society who make fair contributions to our common good and receive fair benefits in return 16t https en wikipedia org wiki Sixteen Tons cap myth https www wiley com en us The+Myth+of+Capitalism 3A+Monopolies+and+the+Death+of+Competition p

		date: "15 Sep 2018",
    url: "blog/hbowie/why-i-call-myself-a-practopian.html",
		content: "I suffered a crisis of faith a few years ago a crisis of faith in my atheism My prior loss of faith had come much earlier One Sunday when I was still a young child I had opened a kitchen cupboard and discovered therein the indisputable evidence a cardboard box which had originally held the large chocolate egg found in my Easter basket that morning Instantly I realized with penetrating insight that the basket had not come from some mysterious bunny but from my very own parents And if they had lied to me about the bunny why should I believe these odd stories of theirs about God And so began a protracted phase in which I happily referred to myself as an atheist A few years ago though I began to have doubts Not about the existence of some omnipotent omniscient supernatural being I was still pretty sure that neither the Easter Bunny nor God were real in that sense No this crisis of faith was a deeper one about whether it was at all sufficient to identify myself primarily with a system of thought based entirely on disbelief Now of course somewhere along the way I had considered calling myself a humanist rather than an atheist And that felt more accurate whatever belief I had been able to muster over the years had been in other human beings not in god or church And yet ultimately humanism felt incomplete as well Partially because no matter where I turned I found a different authority offering some new explanation of what they meant by the term But also because whenever I tried to explain humanism to someone else they would stare blankly at me for a while and then when I had finished my semi coherent ramblings would say Eh so you re an atheist then And so bereft of any belief system I could claim for myself I began to cobble together one of my own I began with a sense of mission based on the idea that we humans could work together to forge a brighter future for ourselves And yet I didn t want to imply that I believed in any simplistic notion of some ideal future state Rather I wanted to encourage small practical steps towards gradual betterment And so I came up with the phrase Practical Utopian shortened by contraction to Practopian I decided to avoid all usage of the words God religion and spirituality primarily because these terms have been used by so many different people to mean so many different things that they have become confusing rather than enlightening So on these topics I simply said that I believed in the value of the written word ww but did not deem any particular text to be sacred and irrefutable However I did find that I believed in love And in my connection to other humans And in experiencing a sense of wonder when regarding the cosmos around us Like any good humanist it was easy to state that I believed in science in evolution in education in toolmaking and in the use of critical thinking ct To these I added a belief in the value of systems thinking st since so much of modern life is influenced by vast and complex social political economic and ecological systems I was also able to easily affirm beliefs in the value of mere individuals in our essential liberty in our fundamental equality and in the value of our diversity At the same time I found I believed in the value of human society in the need for governance and in the institutions of democracy including the rule of law law as well as a mix of private and public ownership of property I also affirmed a belief in the value of parenthood as an essential element of any human society And to these societal elements I added a belief in the good of creating value value for ourselves and others I readily expressed an appreciation for the power of human storytelling and for all the different ways in which we use the many forms of art to communicate with one another But then in something of a deviation from traditional humanism instead of simply seeing the culmination of human history as a liberation from superstition into science and rationality I affirmed a belief in the value of human culture and the ongoing evolution of that culture culture I also found that I believed in balance rather than any form of fundamentalism or extremism I believe that despite our various imperfections we all hold some important pieces of the truth and that by integrating our different perspectives integral we can arrive at a more complete understanding of any problem or situation And so by the time I was done I discovered that I had not one thing that I failed to believe in but twenty six things that I did believe in I then proceeded to separate these twenty six beliefs into one Mission thirteen Principles and twelve Values And then for each came up with a brief and basic formulation of my thoughts in most cases just a single sentence Aha Progress So this is how I came to call myself a Practopian and to define what I mean by that However this term and these beliefs are not reserved for my personal use I encourage you to explore the website Practopian org web at your convenience There you ll find everything I ve described today plus more I ve assembled many of my favorite quotations and organized them around these core beliefs core I ve also added additional writings aw supporting and elaborating on many of these beliefs and using them as a starting point for commentary on current affairs and works by others I hope you find all of this enlightening and useful And I even dare to hope that some of you might also come to call yourself Practopians one day I m always interested in meeting like minded folks and

		title: "Why It s a Bad Time to be a Conservative",
		date: "21 Jul 2021",
    url: "blog/hbowie/why-its-a-bad-time-to-be-a-conservative.html",
		content: "All of us humans both individually and collectively have to strike some reasonable balance between doing what we ve done before safe but boring and trying something new exciting but risky And when considering these two alternatives of course doing what we ve done before generally wins Because we know that what s been done before has worked And because we also know that lots of things don t work in fact many things fail spectacularly And so very wisely we generally stick with things that have been shown to work George Santayana gs nicely summed up this wisdom for us back in 1906 > Progress far from consisting in change depends on retentiveness When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement and when experience is not retained infancy is perpetual Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it In other words if we can t remember what worked and what didn t before then we re likely to repeat the stuff that didn t work with equally disappointing and often disastrous results This tendency to repeat what has worked before is well known in business And as Santayana pointed out it s generally a good thing But at times it can hold back progress This is one reason why founder Jeff Bezos always insisted that every day at Amazon would be Day One day1 And it s also a reason why many business improvement leaders look for what they call a burning platform burn to motivate change because often people won t try something new until they re forced to leave their old ways behind So how does all this apply to politics In the New Oxford American Dictionary the first definition for conservative is averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values In a similar vein Wikipedia wiki defines Conservatism as the outlook that embodies the desire to preserve existing things held to be either good in themselves or better than the likely alternatives or at least safe familiar and the objects of trust and affection So far so good Repeating the safe things that have worked before is a universal human instinct and a valuable one So what s the problem with being a conservative in the 21st century Just this everything has already changed and it s continuing to change at an unforgiving pace Let s put the history of humanity hhist in a little context We live on a planet that has existed for over 4 5 billion years We ve had life on this orb for at least 3 5 billion years Human ancestors have been around for about 6 million years Modern humans in the form of Home Sapiens have existed for a little over 300 000 years Civilization as we know it is only about 6 000 years old We ve had industrialization for just a little over 200 years We ve only had digital technology for a little over 50 years And now let s turn our attention to population levels uspop just focusing for now on the United States Prior to colonization about 4 million humans lived in the lands now part of the US and Canada By 1800 we had about 5 million people counted by the US census which at this point excluded Native Americans It took only eighty years for this number to grow tenfold to a total just over 50 million in 1880 By 1920 our population size had doubled to a total just over 100 million In another 50 years by 1970 our population had doubled again to just over 200 million And in the next 50 years by 2020 our population had grown again this time by over 50 to a figure topping 330 million And although I ve been focusing on the US a similar story has of course been playing out in the rest of the world So the important point to be made here is that when we look at any sort of historical timeline involving life on Earth we cannot help but observe that in terms of both technology and population levels the degree of change we have seen in the last two hundred years is both staggering and unprecedented And so for one wishing to be a conservative we are forced to ask if you d like to keep things the way they are or the way they were how do you propose to undo or even slow the rapid pace of population growth and technological change Now of course one might argue as many have that all of this change has generally been for the best and that the steady and continued flow of progress depends on hewing to the same principles that have brought us this far things like private ownership free enterprise social values based on God family and hard work and so on And here s where we run into the particular problem with being a conservative today because it is becoming increasingly apparent to all that through a combination of our ever growing human population and our rampant industrialization we have brought the only planet we have to the brink of ecological collapse For quite a while the signs had to be sought out but now they are staring at us from every day s headlines Unprecedented heat waves Historic flooding Glaciers melting Rising sea levels Growing droughts Reservoirs drying up Increasing size and scope of wildfires Crops literally being baked in their fields Skyrocketing prices of housing with ever growing numbers of people trying to cram into the same limited geography Species extinction New forms of pollution such as micro plastics plaguing our environment I could go on but you get the idea And so when we look at what we like to call progress over the last few hundred years it s easy to see that it s been fueled by the following factors Invention of new products and services for consumers Invention of new tools and processes used to make more better and cheaper things for consumers Advances in sales and distribution of the items identified above Rising wages and employment levels turning citizens into workers and workers into prolific consumers Competition and free markets forcing companies to continuously innovate and improve or to be replaced Capitalists willing to invest their resources in new and often risky ventures that generally involve selling more and better things to even more consumers And all these forces have brought us to the point at which looking at today s headlines I see News of a wildfire in Oregon bootleg that s so big and hot that it s generating its own weather Reports of Jeff Bezos bezos the richest human on earth returning from a flight to space and declaring Best day ever I m not sure how anything other than this obscene juxtaposition could better encapsulate the failure of free enterprise to address our growing environmental crisis And in truth we are now at a moment in human history when the production of more and better consumer goods is not what we need If individuals could purchase some individual shelter from the effects of ecological collapse then no doubt our innovative capitalists would devise new products and services to meet the demand If Bezos could sell me my own individual biosphere that contained everything I needed to sustain friends and family well into the future then I would probably have one sitting on my doorstep about now But our environmental crisis is global and solutions must be global This perforce takes individual consumers out of the picture There is no way we as individuals can consume our way out of our current problems and hence no way that producers of consumer goods and services can innovate our way out of our environmental crisis And so no matter how we choose to define the conservative position whether in terms of a general tendency to preserve the current order of things or a more focused political definition involving the defense of free enterprise private property and traditional social norms it is hard to see how any of this will do us much good about now This is perhaps why when we read about the newly formed Conservative Climate Caucus ccc we are unsurprised that it has nothing of substance to offer And also perhaps why the American Conservative movement has devolved so dramatically into what it is today for it is not so much that this particular crop of conservatives has turned out badly but more that conservatism as a whole has been backed into a corner by our current situation and simply has nothing in its bag of tricks that will help us out of the spot we find ourselves in today huddled together on the burning platform of planet Earth and being forced to consider trying

		title: "Why I Use Markdown And Why You Should Too",
		date: "25 Feb 2020",
    url: "blog/hbowie/why-i-use-markdown-and-why-you-should-too.html",
		content: "What is Markdown and why should you care Let s just start by saying that Markdown is a deceptively simple tool for writers Why do I call Markdown s simplicity deceptive If you re coming from Microsoft Word trade or Google Docs or Apple Pages then at first glance using Markdown might seem like going from a fully loaded luxury sports sedan to a dune buggy as you look aghast at how much you d be giving up you first balk and then start to back away and finally are tempted to turn tail and flat out run But that would be a mistake Because many of the things you d be giving up turn out to actually be liabilities if you re at all serious about your writing What Markdown Is Markdown is a plain text syntax that allows anyone to write using an easy to learn easy to read easy to type format along with a set of tools enabling that text to be easily transformed into HTML or practically any other system used for storing displaying and printing textual documents Let s break this down a bit Plain text This means that a chunk of text written using Markdown can be saved to a simple text file and stored on practically any computing system or device in use today It also means that your Markdown text can be edited using any text editor Easy to learn read and type A blank line is used to separate paragraphs An asterisk can be used to indicated a bulleted item that is part of a list A number followed by a period and a space is used to indicate an item that is part of a numbered list Use one or more hash symbols ` ` to indicate a heading Surround a word with asterisks to indicate italics There now you already know many of the more common conventions And all of these are easy to type using your keyboard and the resulting text is easy to read even if you don t really know that it is Markdown and haven t memorized the rules Transformation tools The original tool was written in Perl by Markdown s author John Gruber all hail the Daring Fireball https daringfireball net But a whole slew of tools supporting Markdown authoring and transformation are now available on pretty much every platform you might want to use for writing Many of these are open source and free while others are relatively inexpensive Why You Should Use Markdown 1 A distraction free writing environment You can just focus on your words and not have to worry about page margins page breaks font sizes or colors or any of the myriad other options generally staring you down when you fire up a traditional WYSIWYG word processor 2 Freedom from technical limitations When you save your writing in a Markdown formatted text file you don t have to worry about losing access to your work because some technology or proprietary file format has gone out of date or is no longer supported 3 Freedom from licensing constraints You will no longer be dependent on a single vendor to keep your words alive and available and you will no longer need to pay a subscription fee just to be able to continue to read your own work and you will no longer have to worry about the terms under which some corporation has agreed to host your words on its servers 4 Freedom from writing and publishing silos Most other writing systems are designed to capture your words and then store them for some period of time in a particular corporate silo from which there is no easy escape Markdown on the other hand stores your words in a form that can easily be uploaded to any of these same platforms without relying on any of those platforms as the sole source for your work With Markdown your words become the raw material for one or more of your publishing factories always available to be used in any way you wish 5 Designed first and foremost for the Web In case you haven t noticed many of the words we write these days get sent out via email and or posted to a website In either of these cases HTML is a native first class language And anything you write in Markdown can be easily converted to HTML and so can be easily emailed and or published on the Web In contrast when authors start with text formatted in some word processing system they must rely on copy and paste to move their words from one place to another and then try to find and fix all sorts of formatting anomalies that show up in the results 6 Build a Site and not just a Doc The Web is designed to allow users to easily link from one page to another And most websites consist of a set of relatively short pages that are interlinked When you re writing in Markdown it s easy to create a bunch of small files with links to one another In most other writing systems that were originally designed to create stand alone printable documents this sort of linking is typically fraught with peril And you make your words more usable by presenting them in small interlinked chunks rather than one long linear document that few people will ever finish 7 Choose from a wide variety of tools You don t need to use one and only one particular piece of software to create or transform your work pick the one that you like the best Switch to another one whenever you like 8 Gain respect from your more technical colleagues If you are working with web authors or software developers chances are that they are already using Markdown in one form or another Why Because they re already used to working with text files and for all the other reasons listed above Getting Started For more info on the Markdown syntax John Gruber s Daring Fireball page https daringfireball net projects markdown syntax is still the best place to start To start writing the only thing you need is a text editor https en wikipedia org wiki Text editor but if you don t already have a favorite then it s easiest to pick one specifically designed for Markdown authors I use iA Writer https ia net writer and I m happy to recommend it but you ll easily find others to choose from using any of your customary search techniques When you re ready to publish your words somewhere an editor with built in Markdown support comes in handy For example I can export this piece to HTML PDF or Microsoft Word without ever leaving iA Writer similarly I can publish it as a new draft on Medium https medium com hbowie from the same app And many blogging platforms accept Markdown without any conversion needed On the other hand if you re using a garden variety text editor for your writing and are on a Mac then the Marked 2 app https marked2app com is a handy tool for previewing your text as well as for exporting in any of several different formats And once you re really into Markdown and if you re a denizen of the Apple ecosystem then you might be interested in Airmail https airmailapp com and or MailMate https freron com both of which allow you to compose emails using Markdown And while I m at it if your preferred platform happens to be a Mac I may as well mention my own app Notenik https notenik net which is a Markdown enabled note taking app that can also be used for publishing entire websites It s free and open source and available from the Mac App Store In Conclusion If you re a writer who has any respect for the words you re producing then you owe it to yourself to use Markdown On the other hand if your only concern is to keep to the cackle and write nicely https practopian org quotes merely a muddle html then whatever you re currently using will probably continue to suffice A Postscript for Office Workers Let s face it for many of you working in corporate office environments your job description involves producing page after page of documents and slide decks that will at best be skimmed once or twice and then stowed away for aeons in some sort of digital file share where they will probably never be found again Hey if that s your gig then I respect it and you d probably be spitting into the wind trying to use Markdown in such an environment On the other hand I will say this if more organizations were using Markdown rather than word docs and digital slide decks they would probably be wasting less time and making better decisions In my experience all of the formatting options found in traditional office tools are generally used to disguise a lack of critical original thinking and divert and distract an audience from the actual thoughts being expressed On the other hand if all you have to express your thoughts are your words and a few minimal formatting options then it s easier for people to evaluate your ideas on their own merits"

    url: "blog/hbowie/why-mandating-x-days-a-week-in-the-office-is-a-stupid-idea.html",
		content: "As the pandemic eases increasing numbers of companies and employees are running out of health related reasons why everyone who can work from home needs to do so And yet employees have gotten used to skipping the daily commute have proven that they can remain productive in their pajamas and are often struggling to find good reasons why they need to return to their pre pandemic office hours or even some semi reasonably mandated hybrid schedule One high profile example of the rebellion brewing is Ian Goodfellow Apple s director of machine learning who recently announced his departure from this bastion of high tech due to its return to work policy https twitter com ZoeSchiffer status 1523017143939309568 I understand the tension There are many reasons why companies want their employees toiling away in their offices some of them good and some of them bad And there are many reasons why employees might want to work from home most of them good and in a few cases some not quite so good And so when occupants of the C suite ask themselves How many days each week must our employees come into the office it is understandably a hard question and there s no one answer that is going to please everyone But that s why they make the big bucks right Wrong Apple execs should remind themselves of the time when Steve Jobs came back from a visit with Sony in Japan all fired up with a great idea for Apple employees they should all come to work everyday wearing the same slick corporate vests https 9to5mac com 2011 10 11 steve jobs book excerpt why he wore the black mock turtleneck uniform Jobs later recalled Oh man did I get booed off the stage Everybody hated the idea But if execs cannot mandate the same corporate attire for everyone what makes them think that mandating a certain number of days per week in the office is a good thing The same flaw lurks in both approaches every employee is not the same Every situation is not the same Every team is not the same And so Jobs realized that the idea of having a corporate uniform was not really a good idea Instead it was best to let each employee decide how to dress each day In other words it was best to grant each employee autonomy https keylists org autonomy html in regards to their own attire Announcing a return to work policy mandating a certain number of days per week in the office is a simple thing to do Too simple really Certainly too simple minded for the big brains hauling down the huge salaries while sitting in their corner offices The problem is that this sort of decision is treated as an HR issue with the tacit assumption that working from home is an employee benefit and so must be rationed and administered in the same way as other benefits like vacation days and salaries letting everyone have just the right amount but not letting anyone have too much But working from home is not like that Unlike real employee benefits working from home is not a simple transactional affair of withdrawing a certain amount of money from the corporate coffers and transferring it in one way or another to the accounts of employees Instead working from home has the following characteristics + Reduces the waste for everyone employees workers and communities required for the commute between home and office + Makes workers more productive in many cases + Costs the company nothing And so clearly the right number of days to work from home and the right number to work in the office is different for different employees and more importantly for different teams Ian Goodfellow alluded to this element of the problem in the departure note he wrote to staff saying I believe strongly that more flexibility would have been the best policy for my team And so by not allowing flexibility on this issue autonomy https keylists org local autonomy html if you will what are corporate bosses saying about their employees + We can t trust our employees our teams or our team leaders to make responsible decisions about when to work from home and when to come into the office + We think our employees are lazy people who will goof off if not closely supervised in person + We think our team leaders are spineless wretches who won t stand up to their employees when needed to make decisions that are right for their teams + We want our employees in close proximity so that we can physically intimidate them when needed Maybe they don t mean to imply all of these things But even if they are only thinking some of them which of these do they imagine will go down well with employees And if they simply issue a general corporate mandate for a minimum number of days per week in the office aren t they leaving it up to employees to supply their own interpretations of the rationale Or do they really think that employees will swallow the notion that every employee every job and every team will benefit equally from the irreplaceable benefits of in person collaboration https www businessinsider com apple director machine learning ian goodfellow leaving return to office 2022 5 to exactly the same degree and with exactly the same number of days together in the office Yes I get it that Apple was built from a ton of face to face collaboration And I understand that they only recently completed work on what might be the most expensive corporate offices that look like a spaceship in the known universe And I understand how easy it is to issue a corporate memo announcing a new policy instead of standing up on a stage in front of your employees to tell them what you are thinking But there is a reason why local autonomy was one of the eight Core Design Principles for Effective Teams https practopian org blog hbowie core design principles for teams html as documented by Elinor Ostrom who won a Nobel Prize for her work And there s a reason why the notion of scaling this principle of autonomy as organizations grow to form teams of teams was another of these eight core design principles And it s for the same reason that one of the twelve principles behind the Agile Manifesto https agilemanifesto org principles html stated > Build projects around motivated individuals give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done Times and conditions change Working from home once viewed as a luxury or a temporary aberration has become a new normal and many of our best knowledge workers have adapted to these evolving conditions and found ways to make them work as well or better than the old ways for themselves for their teams for their families for their communities and yes for their corporate overlords Now of course some face to face work is still important But the best way to stress this importance is not through a corporate mandate levied mindlessly on all employees It was a famous hockey player who said he always liked to skate to where the puck was going to be but this was an ambition famously emulated by Steve Jobs as well I think the puck has moved on Time for CEOs and other corporate execs to catch up"

Stephen grew up watching televised Michigan football games with me from our home in Scottsdale Arizona And then our son decided to attend the University of Michigan for his college career starting in 2005 By then though college football had changed as had the world Ohio State had become a dominant tier 1 team that regularly competed for a national championship while Michigan was struggling to remain relevant as a tier 2 team And the annual meeting between Michigan and Ohio State on the football field had become more of a ritual humiliation for Michigan than a legitimate competition And so when the Ohio State Buckeyes came to Ann Arbor this year in 2021 Michigan fans hoped and prayed for a victory but we also dreaded having to sit through another terrible loss And few people honestly expected Michigan to win this year Well except perhaps for coach Jim Harbaugh his staff and his players Because you see to beat Ohio State at football is a terribly hard thing to do That s the way it s been for over a hundred years And that s the way it s supposed to be It s not supposed to be easy The outcome is never certain This is why the annual football game played between these two teams has no fancy name The winner does not receive a cup of any kind There is no need for branding or for some symbolic token of victory If you are at all connected to these two schools or to these two states then you understand that it is simply The Game And you know who last won It s something you wake up with each morning and go to bed with every night And you know when the next meeting will be And you fully realize how sweet a victory would be this year and how bitter a loss And you know that you will carry that feeling with you whatever it turns out to be for all of the coming year And so when the University of Michigan and The Ohio State football teams met in Ann Arbor this year there were all of the usual hopes and dreams being focused on that playing field on those 100 yards of turf but there was more Because Ohio State had won the last eight games And they were favored to win again this year And that s just not right Because even though beating Ohio State at football is a terribly hard thing to do humans are built to do such things We can figure out how to fly We can defeat dictators We can send people into space and return them safely We can conquer terrible diseases These things have never been easy And we humans still have a whole host of hard things out in front of us all needing heroes to do them And there are always so many reasons why these difficult tasks may feel impossibly hard People have to put aside their differences find common cause and work together We have to resist cynicism and dare to believe not that we will win but that we can win and that victory will be worth the effort We have to do everything we know how to do and then do more We have to rise up from defeat saying We will try again We need to embrace our heroes not just those with familiar faces and names but those who rise to greatness on the field of battle and earn a name for themselves whether they are in the spotlight or whether they are winning the battle in the trenches fighting for every inch of ground And so as I sat down with my son to watch The Game this year I knew how much this annual contest meant And then as we watched these two teams compete on that snowy field for the next sixty minutes we were privileged to see unfold before us one of those priceless historic Michigan victories not by a few points but ending in a score of 42 27 leaving no room for doubt about which was the better team on that day It was played as it should be played with each team fighting for every point and for every yard on the playing field And we won And we won because we had a team full of heroes So much had to be done to gain this win So many failures and mistakes had to be avoided Every Michigan player wearing Maize and Blue on that day had a part to play and every one of them played it to virtual perfection Because anything less would not have been enough As I ve reflected back on that victory over the past day or two I ve been surprised at how much it means to me As a Michigan Wolverine of course I have that warm glow that comes from knowing that we emerged victorious and vanquished our rivals and that we get to carry that victory with us for the entire coming year And yet there s more In some of the darkest days of World War II British leader Winston Churchill told his people > It s no use saying We are doing our best You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary And this year I saw our Michigan team do what was necessary And yes I know it s only a football game But to beat Ohio State at football is a terribly hard thing Always has been And I trust it always will be And in this of all years after eight straight losses I m sure it could easily have felt impossibly hard And yet a team full of heroes emerged rose up against all odds donned the Maize and Blue on that day and accomplished what many had told them would be impossible And so when I woke up the day after The Game much about our world was still the same We humans still face terribly hard challenges There are still just as many reasons why we might fail But I awoke with new hope Because I now know again that we humans can do terribly hard things I ve seen it happen Right before my eyes"

		content: "A little over a century ago Irish poet W B Yeats https en wikipedia org wiki W B Yeats wrote what is probably his most famous poem The Second Coming https www poetryfoundation org poems 43290 the second coming The cultural context for the poem was in some ways similar to ours today the 1918 1919 flu pandemic was still active the First World War had recently ended the Easter Rebellion had recently occurred which was an armed insurrection of Irish Republicans trying to overthrow British rule And of course there was religious discord between Catholics and Protestants Perhaps I need not belabor the parallels but just to make sure my point is clear + Our world order has been upset by a global pandemic in a way that has not happened in a century since the misnamed Spanish Flu of 1918 1919 which was still very much active when Yeats wrote his work + Many of our cultural and political clashes today are centered around differences in religious beliefs most notably between those who hold to some form of Christianity vs those who have adopted a more secular or vaguely spiritual worldview paralleling the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants in Yeats time and place + Many of our US states are chafing against rule by a remote and distant government located in Washington DC And somewhat ironically the United Kingdom has itself only recently overthrown governance by distant EU rulers https en wikipedia org wiki Brexit in Brussels All of which is similar to the desire in Yeats time to assert an Irish Republic s independence from Britain + Ukraine is now resisting a violent attempt by Russia to assert its right to claim that country as part of its empire in the most violent armed conflict to threaten Europe since our last World War + Here in the US we are daily hearing fresh evidence concerning the violent attempt to overthrow our lawful government in the attempted insurrection of January 6 2021 And so let me quote the first stanza of Yeats famous poem for you now with the very definite idea that his description of the political and cultural climate of Ireland in 1919 1920 might also apply to our situation today in 2022 and particularly in the US > Turning and turning in the widening gyre > The falcon cannot hear the falconer > Things fall apart the centre cannot hold > Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world > The blood dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere > The ceremony of innocence is drowned > The best lack all conviction while the worst > Are full of passionate intensity The second and final stanza of his poem is more dramatic but less pertinent to my purposes for the moment so I will not continue the quotation here But I am haunted as I hope you are by the way that these words from Yeats portray our situation today considering that + Our politics continue to turn in the widening gyre as the voices from both the right and the left continue to spin ever further from some reasonable middle ground + Those making that flight seem to turn increasingly deaf ears to any opinions other than their own including public opinion such that the falcon can no longer hear the falconer + Our very democracy starts to fall apart as a reasonable center can no longer hold our attention our interest or our support + As we repeatedly study the efforts to overturn our government via the attempted insurrection of January 6th and as we survey the more extreme positions of our political leaders on both the left and the right open borders on the left support for white nationalists on the right we envision the prospects of mere anarchy being loosed upon the world + When we look on the horrific massacre of children in Uvalde as well as comparable armed massacres at schools and places of worship across our land it is hard not to believe that the blood dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned + Although we might not agree on the descriptors of best and worst I think we can easily agree that extremists at both ends of our political spectrum are full of passionate intensity while those somewhere closer to the center are criticized https www nytimes com 2022 06 28 us politics biden democrats roe response html for their lack of conviction And so here we are violence on the loose with more threatening to erupt every day all of our media and political systems working to further turn us against each other citizen against citizen because that s what generates the most money for their corporate masters institutions that once held us together in some form of productive unity now straining at the seams threatening to fly apart all who can be heard above the fray openly questioning the value of continuing to preserve our existing social and political order So where is all of this is going to lead Where are we headed And do most of us really want to end up there Yeats could not foresee any practical solution to this dilemma and so he in his second and final stanza turned to his own active imagination represented by Spiritus Mundi https en wikipedia org wiki Anima mundi to conjure up a monster for the ages out of a few mere words A shape with lion body and the head of a man and so forth But then he didn t have streaming services Today most of us can easily choose our multimillion dollar monsters for our evening entertainment with a flick of the remote control whether it be the latest from Stranger Things or something from the archives In both cases though at least for my purposes today these are mere distractions from the pressing issues at hand Will we continue to sit on the sidelines powerless while we watch our society being torn apart Or can we muster up the resolve and courage and resources to stand up for something as unromantic as what might be called the Reasonable Middle This is my intention And I ll spell out these intentions in more specific terms in a few other posts to follow Stay tuned"

		title: "Will the Circle be Unbroken",

    url: "appreciation/will-the-circle-be-unbroken.html",
		content: "I first heard this song as the title track on the monumental 1972 album by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band which they recorded with a number of country music greats who were still alive at the time This song is usually recorded under the title of Will the Circle be Unbroken but it s also known by the name Can the Circle be Unbroken wp The song was the result of a reworking by A P Carter ap of the hymn Will the Circle be Unbroken wp2 The song was first released in 1935 on a single by the Carter Family cf There are a number of wonderful recordings of this song that I can recommend I ll list them in chronological sequence The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band track1 from their 1972 album Will the Circle be Unbroken album1 The Country Gentlemen track2 from their 1988 album Folk Songs and Bluegrass album2 Tim O Brien and Darrell Scott track3 from their 2012 album We re Usually A Lot Better Than This album3 as the second half of a medley starting with When There s No One Around All three albums by the way are worth repeated listening in their entirety It s certainly fair to categorize this song as a religious one and more particularly as a Christian one and yet even though I consider myself to be a non believer my lack of faith doesn t diminish my appreciation for this song in the slightest if anything I think it increases it For unlike many songs that we could put in this category this song does not seek to proselytize or ask us to accept any particular religious teaching Let s see how it does work and consider what it is doing > I was standing by my window > On one cold and cloudy day > When I saw the hearse come rolling > For to carry my mother away Note how this first verse paints a simple but altogether complete dramatic scene for us We can see the singer and the sight that s he is viewing Just four simple lines twenty five of the simplest words in the English language and yet it is hard to hear them without feeling a wave of desolate bereavement I d like to save consideration of the song s chorus until the end so let s proceed straight to the second verse > Well I told that undertaker > Undertaker please drive slow > For this body you are hauling > Lord I hate to see her go Again it is a very simple scene described using common everyday words And so far we have heard no suggestion of religious belief In fact instead of painting a picture of some sort of spiritual afterlife we are being given very graphic physical images of corporeal death Note especially the use of the word hauling in this respect There s no attempt to gussy up what is happening here it is a physical person performing a job driving a vehicle hauling a load and ultimately taking that load under the ground > Oh I followed close behind her > Tried to hold up and be brave > But I could not hide my sorrow > When they laid her in the grave Again the story continues in a very simple linear physical fashion > I went back home my home was lonesome > Missed my mother she was gone > All of my brothers sisters crying > What a home so sad and lone And now in the last verse we have the completion of this little tale And in the spare telling we have more than a suggestion of the sparseness of the lives of these characters There is no mention of flowers no mention of a church no word of a supportive group of family and friends in attendance no meal no food no mention of any speeches eulogizing the lost loved one In short there are none of the usual conventions that we employ to soften the blow of death nothing to gloss over this naked experience of loss that the song has just shared with us Instead we just have these very simple brush strokes Part of the genius of the song is that there are enough details here to place us fully in the story as it unfolds to let us see and feel at one with the singer yet there are no details that limit the universality of the tale In fact I listened to this song on the day that my own mother was buried in a country churchyard a few years ago and there was nothing in that moment to separate the singer s grief from my own So now finally let us consider the chorus of the song > Will the circle be unbroken > by and by Lord by and by > Please tell me there s a better home a waiting > in the sky Lord in the sky At the beginning of the third line I ve inserted words sung by O Brien and Scott in their rendition because those words seem to provide a better fit for these last two lines in the greater context of the song as a whole And so here in this moment of loss the singer asks if what has been broken what has been lost on this day may someday be restored and once again be made whole And who hasn t felt this same longing No matter what your religious orientation no matter what your once or future beliefs who can lose a beloved family member a parent in particular without feeling that something once whole has been broken and without feeling a great yearning to have that family restored and made whole again This is not a song of religious dogma it is a song that speaks to a wellspring of religious feeling to a tragic knowledge of time and what it brings to all of us and yet an inescapable human desire to transcend death in some way to feel a part of something larger that will live on after death This feeling is part of what it means to be human to know that our parents meant so much to us to know how much they passed on to us in terms of their knowledge and beliefs and feelings and love and with that bequest also passed on an obligation for us to keep these gifts alive This is perhaps why the name of this song is so moving as the title for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album from 1972 because the recording of that album was itself an attempt to acknowledge the great gifts bequeathed to a younger generation by their elders and to document those gifts in a way that could be in turn passed on to others So while this song comes from a Christian tradition for me it is also a song of humanism because it so vividly describes an important dimension of what being human means for all of us album1 https amzn to 2MLs4nR album2 https amzn to 2OAaLaa album3 https amzn

		content: "Whether we are talking about the King James Bible The Catcher in the Rye On the Origin of Species or Wikipedia we can recognize that writing things down is an important means of preserving human knowledge and wisdom and that both writing and reading are invaluable human activities Author Carl Sagan made a compelling case for the importance of the written word in his own book The Demon Haunted World Science as a Candle in the Dark sagan calling it the great invention > For 99 percent of the tenure of humans on earth nobody could read or write The great invention had not yet been made Except for firsthand experience almost everything we knew was passed on by word of mouth As in the children s game Telephone over tens and hundreds of generations information would slowly be distorted and lost > > Books changed all that Books purchasable at low cost permit us to interrogate the past with high accuracy to tap the wisdom of our species to understand the point of view of others and not just those in power to contemplate with the best teachers the insights painfully extracted from Nature of the greatest minds that ever were drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history They allow people long dead to talk inside our heads Books can accompany us everywhere Books are patient where we are slow to understand allow us to go over the hard parts as many times as we wish and are never critical of our lapses > > Books are key to understanding the world and participating in a democratic society Current Trends Given this context I d like to make a few comments on some of the current trends affecting the state of the written word today Video We are besieged today by video productions On television we have hundreds of channels that broadcast 24 hours a day We have millions of YouTube videos Arguably some of these things teach somebody something But overall are they making us smarter Or dumber I tend to think the latter I tend to think that reading a good book enhances our ability to parse new ideas and make sense of unfamiliar concepts For me reading a good book does for my mind what going to the gym does for my body There are certainly some films that have a similar effect that make me think In general though I find that videos are an easy way to allow someone else to do my thinking for me It s a bit like watching an exercise video while reclining on the sofa It s not the same thing as going to the gym Advertising One of the great things about books is that they do not include any advertising other than perhaps a few pages at the beginning or the end listing other books by the same author or from the same publisher What a treat to be able to read without interruptions or distractions What a joy to be able to concentrate on the information and ideas that one author has worked so hard to convey What a luxury to be able to dive into text thick with complex ideas and be free to work my way through it at my own pace Advertising that is so omnipresent in other media and especially on the Web continually robs us of these benefits Social Media Isn t it interesting that our most popular social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook started out with a focus on words and have gradually shifted to a focus on images It s hardly worth posting something these days if it s not accompanied by a picture or a video who will ever read it And unless you have something to say that can be compressed and captured in a catchy graphic meme it s hardly worth saying In many ways the concern over fake news being spread by these platforms is a bit of a distraction from what should be our main concern which is the systemic dumbing down of most of the conversations being facilitated by these media channels The Race to Capture the Most Attention It is unfortunate that most voices in our culture today are driven primarily by the desire to capture the attention of as many people as possible as quickly as possible for as long as possible It is unfortunate because this changes the nature of the writing the subject of the writing and the presentation of the writing It results inevitably in a drive to appeal to the lowest common denominator of the audience which seems to get lower every day Search the Web for tips on how to write for the Web and you will find thousands of pages all telling you in so many words to dumb down your content There is only one problem here if you continually make your content dumber how will you ever hope to make your audience smarter Web Publishing Failures of Imagination The early days of the Web were days of experimentation At this stage the Web much like the early days of the earth according to Genesis was a formless void Early Web authors were free to format their writings in any way that suited them and to have pages link to one another following any scheme they might imagine This resulted in a lot of bad websites but also in a lot of creative useful new ways to organize written content Then came blogging And while this resulted in a number of great blogs publishing remarkable worthwhile content it led to the creation of blogging software And blogging software led web authors to think that the only way to publish and organize written content was to publish one new short piece after another and that the only way to organize this content was to show readers the newest piece first followed in chronological order by progressively older pieces Which is ok if all you want to do is blog But if you want to organize shorter pages into something that is more than the sum of its parts something like a book then you will generally feel like you are swimming against the current of the modern Web and will not find a whole lot of help or support for more creative approaches to organizing your content And so in summary many modern trends concerning words writers and readers are not tremendously helpful How the Practical Utopian is Different Since these points might not otherwise be obvious let me just take a few moments to list the ways in which I m doing all I can to buck these trends at Practopian org pract 1 No advertising 2 No paywalls or fees 3 No pop ups asking you to subscribe to anything 4 No cookies or tracking of your personal information 5 Permissive copyright under the terms of this Creative Commons license ccl allowing anyone to share and adapt my content so long as they provide attribution and publish their own works under the same liberal terms 6 Challenging material I want you to be smarter after reading my stuff I won t talk down to you 7 Quotations from a host of worthwhile authors quotes almost always with references to the books or other sources from which the words were taken 8 Minimal use of social media if you d like to keep up with what I m doing the best ways are to regularly visit the website pract subscribe to my old school RSS feed rss follow me on Twitter or sign up for our email publication email which comes out every week or two 9 Deep site organization Sure the front page shows you the latest additions to the site And I have different types of content for different purposes But material is also carefully organized around a number of big ideas ideas that run throughout all of my writing and the quotations I ve collected In general here at Practopian org https Practopian org I m trying to present meaningful educational content with all the benefits of a traditional book while adding some valuable advantages available with the Web low cost publishing easy updates and a tiered organization to the materials starting shallow and then proceeding gradually to deeper treatments of important topics What We Can All Do Not wanting to encourage simple gnashing of teeth or to merely plug my own work here at The Practical Utopian let me conclude by suggesting a few concrete things you can do to help buck these same trends Provide financial support to organizations that supply you with words worth reading starting with Wikipedia and continuing with your most trusted newspapers and magazines Support your local independent bookstore books I use Amazon all the time but I also make a point of stopping by my local bookstore every once in a while and purchasing a book there Support your local public library lib and your librarians Read something new and challenging At least new to you Support organizations like Page Ahead pgahd that provide books to children in need If you think you can t afford to provide financial support to these sorts of organizations then remember the words of Desiderius Erasmus who wrote to a friend in 1500 saying > When I get a little money I buy books and if any is left I buy food and clothes basics basics index html books http www phinneybooks

It's an unfortunate fact that the United States remains astonishingly backward compared to almost all other advanced Western countries when it comes to education, because in America, what predicts how well a child will do in school is not a child's aptitude or hard work, but the status of the child's parents -- which is to say, their own levels of education and wealth. Other countries suffer from this condition too, but the United States is especially anachronistic. And it's getting worse: The influence of this wealth predictor in the United States today has only been growing stronger in recent years.

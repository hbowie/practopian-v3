Title:  What is a Society?

Seq:    2

Level:  1

Body:

We had best start by defining what it is that we are talking about. 

In the context of this extended discussion, I'd like to use the following definition.

> society: A group of humans who are cooperating with one another in order to achieve a shared goal. 

You will note that this definition is intentionally broad enough to include all sorts of groups, formed for a wide variety of purposes, and of widely varying sizes.

I have a leadership video I&#8217;d like to share with you. And then I'd like to point out several valuable leadership lessons to be gleaned from this entertaining tale of a fiery confrontation between famed football coach Bo Schembechler and one of his student athletes, as recounted by award-winning raconteur John U. Bacon. 


Body:

I have a leadership video I'd like to share with you.

First, some explanation. Every year at the University of Michigan the students select their favorite professors and present them with a "Golden Apple Award." The recipients are then invited to deliver their "ideal last lecture."

John U. Bacon was a recipient of this award for 2009. Bacon is the co-author, with the late Michigan Football coach Bo Schembechler, of the best-selling business book, <cite>[Bo's Lasting Lessons: The Legendary Coach Teaches the Fundamentals of Leadership][bo-bacon]</cite>.

The video clip I'd like to share is an excerpt from Bacon's Ideal Last Lecture. In it, he recounts a story about Schembechler. Now, if you're a fan of Wolverine football, then you probably need no further recommendation. But even if you're not, I think it's a great leadership tale, and Bacon's telling of the story is a work of art all its own.

Now it's obvious that many elements of Bo's leadership style would not translate well into today's corporate environment. For me, though, there are a number of take-aways here that can apply to any leadership role.

1. **Real leadership isn't always as neat and clean as it appears to be from the examples found in textbooks.**

2. **Be memorable.** Different leaders will do this in different ways, but if others can't remember what you told them, then your leadership probably won't be terribly effective.

3. **Be real.** Ultimately, as a leader, all you have to offer is yourself, and if you stop short of giving that 100%, then you cheat yourself and those around you.

4. **Talk straight.** Call things as you see them. Others may not agree with you, but it is your being willing to take a position and tell people how you feel that in turn gives others the freedom to agree or disagree.

5. **Always serve a higher cause.** Note that Bo never asked Andy Cannavino to do anything because Bo had directed him to, or because of Bo's position of authority: instead, he cited the great Michigan football players who had come before them, and the importance of preserving, respecting and extending that tradition.

6. **Focus on natural consequences.** Again, note that Bo never threatened Cannavino with disciplinary action, or with consequences that would be brought on by Bo or his coaching staff: instead, he talked about the losses their football team would suffer and the sense of responsibility that Cannavino would be left with.

7. **Don't wait for assurances that others will follow before you begin to lead.** Note that Bo honestly did not know how Cannavino would respond to their confrontation, and that his coaching staff feared that he was provoking an out-and-out mutiny by his players; these factors, however, did not cause Bo the slightest hesitation.

8. **The highest calling for a leader is not to command others, but to awaken others to their own potential for greatness.** Note that Bo never told Cannavino what to do; he never commanded him or directed him to take any specific, finite actions. And the response Bo got from Cannavino was more than he could have directed: instead of compliance, he got a team captain and a defense that was on fire, delivering 24 quarters of football in which not one touchdown was scored against them.

9. **Leadership is sometimes, of necessity, an incendiary act**: acquisition of fuel and construction of the engine are important, but it still takes a spark of ignition to set things in motion.

    <outline text="My List of Requirements for our Next President" _note="While many of us are waiting for our 2020 presidential candidates to hit the road and give us a chance to to get to know them better, I decided to stop waiting and let them know what I&apos;m looking for in a new president. &#10;&#10;I mean after all, it doesn&apos;t seem fair to make them guess. &#10;&#10;Note that these requirements are presented in what seems to be a logical sequence. Except where otherwise stated, all of these requirements are intended to be of equal priority. &#10;&#10;I&apos;m eager to hear what others think about this list, and am open to revising as I get feedback. I&apos;ve numbered everything to make lines easier to reference in comments. ">
      <outline text="Personal">
        <outline text="Under 70, and in good health.  "/>
        <outline text="Capable of connecting personally with Americans from all walks of life."/>

        <outline text="Thoughtful and articulate."/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Things to Avoid" _note="Here are things I don&apos;t want to hear. ">
        <outline text="&quot;We are the richest nation on earth.&quot;" _note="This phrase always seems to signal that the speaker is a socialist who thinks we are a nation of infinite riches that can afford to be endlessly generous to some disadvantaged population. Let&apos;s just not go there. "/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Policy" _note="Following is a suggested policy values framework. I don&apos;t want to dictate policy, but I do want agreement on what is real and what is important. ">
        <outline text="Immigration and Border Security">
          <outline text="Our nation needs strong borders that minimize illegal immigration."/>
          <outline text="Our immigration policy needs to be focused first and foremost on our own national interests. "/>
          <outline text="As a nation, we cannot continue to absorb large numbers of the globe&apos;s growing human population. We need to stabilize the size of our US population so that we can meet our commitments to adequately provide for our own citizens in the future. "/>
          <outline text="We need to respect the human rights of all people, including those desiring to immigrate, as well as the rights of our own citizens.  "/>
          <outline text="Long-time residents and their families, assuming they are working and without any criminal history, should have a path to citizenship available to them."/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Income and Wealth Inequality">
          <outline text="We need to acknowledge that our society must serve four different (and often overlapping) sets of stakeholders:">
            <outline text="Workers"/>
            <outline text="Business owners and executives"/>
            <outline text="Consumers"/>
            <outline text="Communities"/>
          </outline>
          <outline text="We must acknowledge that, for the last several decades, the playing field has been tilted heavily in favor of business owners and executives, while often paying scant attention to the legitimate needs of consumers, workers and communities."/>
          <outline text="It is important that we preserve significant financial incentives for businesses, business owners and execs."/>
          <outline text="We must begin to undo the excessive transfer of wealth that has operated in favor of the top business owners and execs."/>
          <outline text="We must find a way to provide legitimate living wages, including decent healthcare, for all citizens working legally in our country."/>
          <outline text="We must vigorously defend the rights to safety for consumers and communities, including environmental protections."/>
          <outline text="We must do all of this by bringing legitimate representatives of all stakeholders to the table in order to forge agreements that will be equitable and workable for all four major interest groups: workers, business owners &amp; execs, consumers and communities. "/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Family Planning">
          <outline text="We must provide strong support for all humane methods of family planning, first in our country, but also around the world. The ever-growing size of our global human population is a destabilizing force that will wreak havoc worldwide unless it is slowed and stopped. We must face the reality that global ecological and human systems cannot expand indefinitely to support a continually growing human population. "/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Our Natural Environment">
          <outline text="We must acknowledge that human activity is causing negative impacts on our natural environment in multiple ways:">
            <outline text="Depletion and overuse of natural resources;"/>
            <outline text="Pollution of our land, sea and air, including the emission of greenhouse gases, and including global warming; "/>

          </outline>

          <outline text="We must support global legal and economic systems that provide a stable, enduring basis for peaceful and productive relations between nations."/>
          <outline text="We must work with the international community to discourage players who threaten our joint peace and prosperity, including those who refuse to work within legitimate and established frameworks governing international relations. "/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Military">
          <outline text="We must maintain a preeminent military capability, and must work to counter reasonable projections of realistic threats."/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Seniors">
          <outline text="We must continue to provide for the wellness and financial security of our population of senior citizens through Social Security and Medicare."/>
          <outline text="At the same time, as human lifespans lengthen, it may be reasonable to continue to adjust retirement ages upwards, without impacting any citizens currently receiving benefits, or within five years of receiving benefits."/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Education">
          <outline text="We must continue to provide free public K - 12 education for all children of our citizens."/>
          <outline text="We must work to ensure that a high-quality education is provided equitably to children from all of our communities."/>
          <outline text="The goal of our public education system should be to produce adults who are ready to be constructive members of our society, with the tools they need to continue lifelong learning throughout their lives."/>
          <outline text="We must support the continued, ongoing education of our citizens with a balanced variety of programs. "/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Citizens&apos; Rights">
          <outline text="All of our citizens must be given equal and fair treatment before the law, without regards for skin color, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status, gender orientation or religious labeling."/>

        </outline>
        <outline text="Politics">
          <outline text="We must reduce the amount of time politicians have to spend on fund-raising. Once they are in office, they must be focused on public service."/>
          <outline text="We must reduce the influence of lobbyists and political advertising. In their current states of excess, neither help our voters or our political leaders make fair, informed decisions. "/>
          <outline text="We must support the activities of a free and independent press to help inform our citizenry."/>
          <outline text="All politicians, no matter what their affiliations, must be committed to working together with others for the benefit of their constituents."/>

          <outline text="We must actively manage government to make it more efficient and more effective."/>
          <outline text="All branches and levels of government should have transparent and meaningful metrics that can be used to judge their success, as well as reasonable improvement goals."/>
          <outline text="All laws and regulations should be subjected to regular review, and should be simplified, streamlined and kept up-to-date on a regular basis."/>
          <outline text="Regulation and enforcement should provide reasonable protections for workers, consumers and communities, without creating an onerous burden for businesses. "/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Technology and Business">
          <outline text="We must encourage and ensure, to the greatest degree possible, a reasonable degree of competition in as many areas as possible."/>
          <outline text="We should not allow companies to defy reasonable public expectations for open and fair competition."/>
          <outline text="We should actively work to develop and promote standards that will allow competitors to interoperate on a level playing field. "/>
          <outline text="We should not allow particular companies to gain and indefinitely retain exclusive, privileged access to information and systems that should best be shared for the benefit of all members of our society."/>
          <outline text="We can and should establish standards for usage of limited, shared resources that should best be used for the benefit of all members of our society. "/>
          <outline text="We have to ensure a level playing field that continues to allow for the entry of new and innovative players. Since larger players often have inherent competitive advantages, this will sometimes mean that smaller players will be given additional help to allow them to compete."/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Use of Personal Information by Large Organizations">
          <outline text="Citizens must have easy, continual, digital access to whatever agreements allow large organizations to collect and use information about them, and they must be able to easily opt-out, at any time, from any such agreements."/>
          <outline text="A universal template should be developed for the definition of such agreements, with emphasis on common language and formats, and ease of understanding by private citizens."/>
          <outline text="All organizations should use this common template for crafting such agreements."/>
          <outline text="Governments must enforce adherence to these agreements, including opt-out provisions."/>
          <outline text="Included in these agreements would be rights for mass contact using emails and telephone numbers; without specific agreements for such mass contact, this sort of contact (phone banks, robocalls, mass emails) should be forbidden by law. "/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Public Health">
          <outline text="We must help collect and leverage and distribute the best information available about threats to the health of our citizenry, in order to inform both private and public actions, including policy decisions."/>
          <outline text="We must be willing to take reasonable actions to minimize threats to our public health."/>
        </outline>

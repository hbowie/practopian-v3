If we want real capitalism — by which I mean a market economy that actually optimizes outcomes for most members of society — then we will have to pay the true price for such a valuable beast. We will have to invest in better government, and improved infrastructure, and the education of all our children, and we will have to give our workers a healthy share of the capital in our society, and we will have to give them enough real freedom — in the form of free time and free information — to become better educated and make better choices, for themselves, for their families and for the civic institutions that are entrusted to act in their interests.

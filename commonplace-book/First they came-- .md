First they came for the communists, 
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist. 

Then they came for the trade unionists, 
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist. 

Then they came for the Jews, 
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew. 

Then they came for me 
and there was no one left to speak out for me.

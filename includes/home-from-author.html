							I write as <em>The Practical Utopian</em> because my twin desires are to be: <br />
							&bull; <em>Down-to-earth</em> &mdash; I try to write short pieces explaining big ideas that will be broadly useful; <br />
							&bull; <em>Idealistic</em> &mdash; I write with the goal of helping all of us achieve better outcomes, both for ourselves and for those around us.

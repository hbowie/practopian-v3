      <p class="card-text">The history of Leonard Cohen&#8217;s song &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; is a fascinating one. Cohen&#8217;s songs had never really been embraced by the masses, and his first recording of &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; in the early eighties was part of an album so lacking in obvious commercial appeal that the president of CBS Records responded to it by saying: &#8220;What is this? This isn&#8217;t pop music. We&#8217;re not releasing it. This is a disaster.&#8221; </p>

      <h4 class="card-title">Hallelujah</h4>
      <p class="card-text">The history of Leonard Cohen's song &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; is a fascinating one. Cohen's songs had never really been embraced by the masses, and his first recording of &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; in the early eighties was part of an album so lacking in obvious commercial appeal that the president of CBS Records responded to it by saying: &#8220;What is this? This isn't pop music. We're not releasing it. This is a disaster.&#8221; </p>

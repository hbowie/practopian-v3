      		Paul Thorn and his 800 Pound Jesus
      	</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="card-text">I&#8217;d been aware of Paul Thorn for some time, but didn&#8217;t really become a fan until I saw him live last summer at The Ark in Ann Arbor. I convinced an old University of Michigan roommate to come with me while I was in town, as an opportunity to catch up, but we were both caught off guard by how much we loved Thorn&#8217;s show. I&#8217;ve been listening to Thorn&#8217;s recordings regularly since then, and can now bear witness to a great catalog that bears deep and repeated listening. </p>
